Gregor Clegane  The Mountain. 
Arrive within a fortnight terrible judgement. 
Attacking him was stupid. You re gonna say 
something clever  Why is he still alive  
Tyrion  speared him through the leg  
before I could finish him. Clean  
You spent too much time what anyone thinks of me. 
That s what you want people with the opinion of a sheep. 
I suppose I should be grateful I m giving you half of our forces. 
. men. and remind her that Lannisters 
pay their debts He s a Lannister. 
Maybe the lowest of the Lannister  the less our name command respect. 
  So the lion does concern himself with the opinion... one of our own 
and hold him captive  with impunity... Before long I ll be dead. 
and you... It s all that lives on. 
Not your personal glory You re blessed with ability 
that few men possess. And you still blessed 
with youth. You served as the glorified bodyguard 
for two kings.. determined in these next few months. 
We could established a dinasty Now. 
You re in pain. The south doesn t seems to agree with you.. 
I knwo the truth Jon Arryn died for.. To pose me riddles  
Has he done this before  a thousand of your friend. 
Your brother... We shared a womb. 
Came to this world together    Do you love your children  
  With all my heart.   In the morning he doesn t remember. 
  You ve always hated him. Every girl in the southern kingdom 
dreamt of him but he was mine by oath. lean and fierce  and black beared 
it was the happiest moment of my life. and did what he did what little he could do 
and whispered in my ear    Lyanna . and he loved her more than me. 
When the king return from his hunts  and you made him give it up. 
All you needed to do is claim the step but that wasn t one of them. 
Oh  but it was. There is no middle ground. 
No  No  No  No.. Yes  my lord. 
Lets start over. Shall we  Slowly. 
You re not fooling them  Your job is to make them 
forget what they know. ease into it. 
Go ahead. inspite of yourself. 
You starting to like this. He s so good... 
he s reaching something deep inside of you Why don t you join us  my lord  
I m saving myself for another. No  not really. 
Impeccable bloodlines  though. Most of my life really. 
Play with her ass. A play thing. She could tell me anything  
anything at all. The castle that she want to live in. 
The man that she wanted to marry. And why wouldn t she  I mean  
Who could compare to him  Do you know what I learned 
losing that duel  That s their game. 
Their rules. That s what I know  that s what I am. 
And only by admitting what we are  You re very lucky girl  
do you know that  Where I come from  
if someone like you attacked a little lord.. your hands and feet chained to four stakes.. 
sea will coming cloaser and closer. Where do you come from  
The Iron Islands. Trust me  you ve never heard 
where I m from neither. In civilised land  you advert 
your betters by their proper titles. Why  
Why  lord of the Iron Islands. 
What s that got to do with you    I will be lord after my father.. 
  So you re not lord now. Is that it  
Just don t understand You re from south of The Wall... 
that make you southerner to me. Do you want to loose that chain  
Theon Greyjoy  Are the two mutually exclusive  
in your experience  I m used to worst than him. 
I m used to men Before the long night comes. 
Why  have been gone for thousand of years. 
It wasn t gone  old man. I missed girls. 
Not even talking to them  Hearing them giggle. 
Don t you missed girls  Why is he alone  
One blast for a ranger returning   He s no rider. 
That s my uncle Benjen rode.. I was never meant to be a father. 
Go on.... Don t think I can t smell it. 
Pay the bastard back  Ned. You ask him if I didn t. Ask him  
I want the funeral feast to be the biggest to taste the boar that got me 
Now leave us  the lot of you   Out  All of you  
You damn fool. after I m death. 
At least they ll say I did this right  this one thing. but you ll do it well. 
The girl.. Varys  Littlefinger  my brother.. 
Worthless.. help him  Ned. 
Make him better than me Give me something to the pain  
and let me die. He commanded us to... 
step aside  but... I wonder  Ser Barristan  
who gave the King this wine  His squire  The Lannister boy  
Such a dutiful boy to make sure is not blame himself. 
His Grace has had a change of heart The Dothraki do things on their own time 
for their own reason My brother... 
was a fool  I know.. but he was Forgive me  khaleesi  but your ancestor  
Aegon The Conqueror  He have no right to them  
he seized them because he could.   You don t believe it  
  Have you ever seen a dragon  khaleesi  who knows what really happened. 
Now if you pardon me    Well  I ll come with you. 
No  no  don t trouble yourself. Jorah  the Andal

You came to us rich.. of proud houses..

Here.. Tonight.. 
We re allowed to look happy.. I want to find my uncle. 
I know he s alive out there. but I m no ranger. 
its the steward s life for me. Not for King 
or a Lord.. or women s love. 
But for the realm.. Think carefully before you say them. 
The penalty for desertion.. Do you want to take your vows before the heart tree   
as your uncle did  a mile north of the Wall.. 
and your Old  Gods too  maybe. Is House Tarly keep the Old Gods  
No  my lord.. The Seven have never answer my prayers.. 
perhaps the Old Gods will. assigned an order.. 
according to our needs.. Pyp  to the stewards. 
Tod  to the builders. Jon  to the stewards. 
Lancel  to the builders. Nikko  to the rangers.  
Eskan  to the rangers. Mikken  to the cooks. 
Halor  to the builders. and the library. 
Pyp... Luke  report to One Eye Joe in the stable.. 
Dareon  I m sending you to the east watch.. and blankets daily..

May I go    Don t you see what they re doing  
  I see ser Alliser revenge thats all.. but maid  
I m a better swordman and rider than any of you  I was singing for a high lord  
at Acorn Hall  I pushed him away and he said.. 
he d have my hand cut off  at the end of the world  
where noone to sing a folk  I ll never been inside a women again. 
Don t tell me about fair. for your starving sister.

Give me an hour and I ll put    Strike  
Tonight  while the castle sleeps. By the time Robert die  
it would be late for the both of us. and delivering him to Stannis  
You have odd notion about  What s the best for the kingdoms  
What s best for the people we rule    He destroyed the Greyjoy fleet. 
  Yes. he s a good soldier  everyone knows that. from their beds. 
You will sail to Dragonstone tonight. Not his captain of the guard. 
And not his wife. Now leave us. 
My lord protector.   So when the king dies.. 
  The throne passes to his brother..   Unless.. 
  There is no  unless   And he cannot take the throne 
without your help. Do you have a shred of honor  
You re now Hand of The King  reach out and take it. 
Make peace with the Lannisters. We ve plenty of time  
to get rid of Stannis.. we simply reveal his little secret.. 
  and sit Lord Renly there instead. I assure you.. 
my price would be modest. Make peace with the Lannisters you say.. 
The people who tried to murder my boy. No... 
I won t do it. He is the heir. 
So why did you call me here  you would help me. 
The queen had a dozen knights  of my household guard. 
I need the Gold Cloaks. Look at you. 
You know what you want me to do. the words stick in your throat. 
When the Queen proclaims one king  Who do they follow  
The man who pays them. I shall live and die at my post. 
 I am the sword in the darkness. I pledge my life and honor to the Night s Watch  
 for this night and all the nights to come. King Robert still wants me dead. 
This poisoner was the first   now that my brother is gone. 
He will never leave you alone. If you sail all the way to the Basilisk Isle  
his spy would tell him. The last Targaryen. 
Your son will have Targaryen blood.. He will not have you either  khaleesi. 
Lord Stark    It s alright. Let him through. 
  Lord Stark... King Joffrey  
King Robert is gone. The City Watch is youts.

And who is to be trusted  I only knew one   
my brother  if it had got him 
the crown. the day that Khal Drogo 
fell from his horse. The people in Westeros 
don t know I m alive. They ll pray for my return  
They ll wave dragon banners and he was a fool. 
You are not your brother.  trust me.  
And it s you I should trust  I don t need trust

No. Oh  no. Give me that. 
If the queen sees I can have   Where are you going  
  To tell her Grace. No more. 
My mother told me  but I I thought 
it would be less   the child. 
You re a woman now. I m fit to bear children 
for the king  bringing little princes 
and princesses into the world  to bring him 
into this world. I screamed so loudly  
I was sure His Grace was not 
with you  Whenever my time was near  
my royal husband and his hounds. 
And when he returned  him there  mind you. 
I had Grand Maester Pycelle  When they told Jaime he wasn t 
allowed in the birthing room  proposed to keep him out. 
Joffrey will show you with all my heart. 
That s so very some womanly wisdom with you 
on this very special day. You ll do things for them that 
you know you shouldn t do. Love no one 
but your children. But... shouldn t 
I love Joffrey  Your Grace   i   Chatter    i  
Who did you say Is she the fat one  
Well  perhaps she s gotten fat Lannister.

Willem Frey s wedding  so drunk the night before that he   
He threw up on his horse   What was his name  
  Bryan. Let me.  
My father was furious  in front of  i the  i  family. 
You didn t  though. You knew when you were needed 
and when to go away. they mean well  
but young men with big jobs  never mind. 
It s embarrassing. covered in your own shit  
I remember everything the rake line in the dirt 
along the list  when you knocked 
Balon Swann from his horse  I ll remember it all 
until I die. And I remember being on the field 
after it was over. I was the last one 
out there.  i to go and sit with my family  i  
at a table so far even see the bride. 
And I couldn t bear to tell them never have the faintest idea 
what I was talking about. S sorry  I   I didn t 
mean to doubt you. I also had to replace someone s 
squire on short notice. The fight against 
the Kingswood outlaws.   Sighs   
He was who only used red. 
I couldn t imagine being how that felt  not to you. 
It s hard to put into a dream 
you ve been dreaming that the dream 
is more real   No. 
I didn t have your gift. I was awful  
a complete liability... a  year old squire. 
It s a good thing at anything else. 
I m not well suited Some men are. 
Ned Stark   right up until the end. 
But me  though     And  
Good prisoners breed are very careful. 
But there is a way  until now. 
What is it  You ll only have 
to do one thing. Jorah the Andal. 
This man must sail the Doom must have protection. 
I didn t come here for the dragons. 
You have them  See what your steel 
is worth. You love her. 
Where are the dragons  Will you betray her again  
Never. Spice King   i I did not leave  i

You re quoting father  He has a good mind 
for strategy  doesn t he  But  yes  he does have 
a good mind for it. Sadly  he s not here. 
It s just you  of the Seven Kingdoms 
and protector of the realm. He needs to start 
acting like a king. And if the entire city 
wants Joffrey dead   I thought the girls 
might help him. If we can t 
control him... He doesn t listen to me. 
It s hard to put a crown on its head. 
I always hoped in a certain light. 
The boy is more for what we ve done  
for our sins. went mad  didn t they  
What s the saying  You ve beaten the odds. 
Tommen and Myrcella   Crying

No. But if she had

There s no denying that. But what do our vows 
have to say about other I don t think Ser Alliser 
cares much for interpretation. We didn t. 
So what s it like  this whole other person. 
And you re wrapped up in them for a little... 
for a little while  I m not a bleeding poet. 
No  you re really not. from my heart. 
There ll be arrows for all They ve already done the worst 
thing to me they could ever do. Of course   
I d had a good bit to drink. And she was nice

You know you never about the bear you never fucked. 
Right now all I want its way into a crow s heart.

I can assure you that was this very library. 
But what he says It s exactly what the survivors 
of their raids report. Love is the death of duty. 
I told that to your friend and neither did you. 
Which is why you ve abandoned about the terrible things 
that may have happened   Yes  you do. 
  No. when you first brought her to me. 
I remember how it sounds. Is it so difficult to imagine 
that an old person was once  A future king always does. 
Some of them were quite forward One of them succeeded. 
I was very young. I could tell you 
everything about her. the color of her eyes  
and the shape of her nose. She s more real than you are. 
We could spend all night a sweeter place to visit

There s a lot more wildlings on the of weapons and things. 
It s the perfect place a spear before. 
I ve never held a sword You re not afraid  
Of course I m afraid. If you re afraid 
of a band of wildlings  I wouldn t have known. 
I wasn t Samwell Tarly anymore. or son of Randyll Tarly 
or any of that. there s no more reason 
to be afraid. I m not nothing anymore. 
Most of their men are up top. They got a big fat one and a

For one night. Mance was testing our defenses. 
He almost made it through. He has   times as many men. 
They ll hit us again tonight. but we ll never beat them. 
Where are we going  an army because of Mance. 
He united  warring tribes. They lose their purpose.  
They go back to fighting each other. And even if they did  even 
if you managed to kill him... They ll kill 
the rest of us  too. They ll flay you. 
They ll make it last days. What s your plan  
They held the gate. We need to burn the bodies. 
Raise the outer gate. What are you doing

Oh  this heat. your summer snows. 
Until tomorrow  My Lord   I took personal charge

Lord Jon often came I have been Grand Maester 
for many years. to you  My Lord. 
A ponderous Tome. of the Great H 
of the Seven Kingdoms  and noble ladies 
and their children.  born to Lord Hother Umber 
and Lady Amaryllis Umber at the last hearth. 
Blue of eye  brown of hair of a wound sustained 
in a bear hunt.  Nothing of import  
My Lord.   What does that mean  
  Oh  For all the weight 
they re given  as first words. 
And you re quite certain Poison. 
A disturbing thought. The Hand 
was loved by all. I ve heard it said that poison 
is a woman s weapon. And eunuchs. 
Did you know that Yes yes  of course. 
How that sort of  i person  i  It s a great honor   
thank you. can stand on one toe 
for hours. Syrio says every hurt 
is a lesson should study cats. 
They re quiet as shadows quick to catch them. 
He s right about that. live with us  
Well  he needs to get a knight of the Kingsguard. 
  He can t be one now  can he  he could be 
Lord of a Holdfast Or he might raise castles 
like Brandon the builder. You will marry 
a high lord shall be knights 
and princes and lords. That s not me. 
Hello. I should warn you  
I don t see   It s warmer. 
  No  that s all right. I m fine. I don t like 
high places. You re afraid of heights 
and almost everything else probably. On the morning of my  Nameday  
my father came to me.  But you re not worthy 
of my land and title. forsake all claim to your 
inheritance and start North.  Then we ll have a hunt 
and somewhere in these woods from your saddle to die. 
Or so I ll tell please me more.  
Ser Alliser s going to make me I m not going to get

That one belongs pretending to read her book

to visit a certain armorer in the city.   Why  
  I have my observers  as I said  visit this armorer several times 
in the weeks before his death. Distrusting me was 
the wisest thing ...Two  three

I m the Captain your name  Ser... 
No  Ser.  so happens that I am. 
He said he d be glad you see. 
Ah  a knight.  i Even the ones who ve never seen  i  
 i an arrow coming their way.  i    There s no telling who has eyes where. 
  Let them look. I regret to say he did not honor me 
with his patronage. Here he is. 
Strong for his age. the helmet you made  lad. 
  This is fine work. the King s Hand  
  If his lordship wants the helm     There s nothing to forgive. 
When Lord Arryn came to visit you  if I was being treated well  
if I liked it here.   Your mother  
  Who she was  what she looked like. She had yellow hair. 
She d sing to me sometimes. If the day ever comes 
when that boy shhh. 
Listen. are in there with him  
Huh  as he insults my sister. 
Forgive me  My Lord   We ve met before  you know. 
Have we  Oh.

 i I ll bet you smell  i   i Come here.  i  
Can I leave this from Lord Stark. 
I don t serve Lord Stark. Impossible  
That s enough. There was no place 
for him in the world  But if Thorne puts me 
up against lady piggy  Yield yield. 
 i I yield.  i  When you re out there 
beyond The Wall a man at your back  
Or a sniveling boy  I should have sent

And if Renly wasn t a king  Who d have thought  
Some say it was one Stannis himself who did it 
after negotiations I say well done. 
It s not what Varys says. which would give Stannis superiority 
over us on both land and sea. And I say father raised you to

Four walls. to a wooden post 
covered in my own It s complicated  yes. 
  So how is our sister  Her son  
Don t. Yes  I know. 
I know the whole bloody of my three judges 
has wished me dead more is my father. 
As for Cersei  to avoid a trial altogether 
by having me killed. The Kingslayer brothers. 
You like it  if I killed your son  
Are you really asking Well  you could 
set me free. nothing else to say. 
What do you want me to do  in the back of a cart  
I m the Lord Commander I d hate for you to do 
something inappropriate. Freeing you is treason. 
Except I didn t do it. A trial. 
If the killer threw himself until my head s on a spike. 
Not just yours. Sansa couldn t 
have done this. Not yet  anyway. 
Where are you taking me  She s waiting for us 
at the Eyrie. Did I kill Joffrey  
I ve been in me out of King s Landing  
but you would never trust too smart to trust a drunk. 
Then perhaps it was in Joffrey s death. 
But you were. I don t understand. 
The Lannisters gave you the Lord of Harrenhal. 
A man with no motive  i your foes confused.  i  
If they don t know who what you plan to do next. 
I don t believe you.  i just like my father s.  i  
You d risk that they risk so little. 
They spend their lives I d risk everything 
to get what I want. My friendship with the 
Lannisters was productive. a crown on his head  
is not a reliable ally. Who could trust you  
I don t want well  that was something my new 
friends wanted very badly. Leaving me alone here 
with these people. There s nothing 
more tedious than a trial. If I have to take one 
more leisurely stroll Have you been 
to see Tommen yet  to the match  
No one tells me anything. He was engaged

Hello. Aren t you Very handsome. 
Joffrey didn t like him. and mix his innards 
up in my food I don t think I am.

Three lords walk into a tavern... the barkeep brings them over

It s funnier in Westeros. ideally. Not at the moment  perhaps. 
Missandei  do you like the wine  Two translators are on a sinking ship.

I ll give you anything. I prefer chicken. 
You ought to join us.   Didn t work out for me.

Or maybe it s the Lord of Light. I don t know. 
What matters  I believe  And whatever it is  it s got 
plans for Sandor Clegane. I ve heard stories. 
If the gods are real... Ah   As water rounds the 
stones  smoothing...  There are some who know every 
verse of the sacred text  and savages who can t read at all 
who understand the Father s wisdom. I had pity for them  but 
I never loved them. The poor disgust us because they are us

I want to speak with you alone. Oh  this is madness  
You re not in your will stroll in here and bash you about... 
  Grandmother.   You could use a good bashing. 
  Grandmother  please.   against the Faith. 
  We marched for you.   They showed mercy. 
  And what about your brother  his crimes and repent. 
If he does  the Faith will allow his name and title... 
  Have you lost your mind  the future of House Tyrell. 
He can begin again. You will leave for Highgarden today. 
There is no law that The Mother watches over us all. 
I ll see you soon  my dear. We said we d fight with you  King Crow  
when the time comes and we meant it  This isn t an army of the dead. 
This isn t our fight. Remember Mance s camp  
It stretched all the way to the horizon. We ll be the last of the free folk. 
That s what ll happen to you if we lose. They know that more than half 
of you are women and children. You re right. 
This isn t your fight. I shouldn t be asking you. 
It s not the deal we made. and we need to beat them if 
you re going to survive. when no other southerners would. 
He died for us. And if that s what we are  
we deserve to be the Are you sure they ll come  
We re not clever like you southerners. I heard you were leaving King s Landing. 
That is hardly your concern. Loras rots in a cell because of you. 
The High Sparrow rules I carry it with me every single day. 
Good. And now we must fight them together. 
We need each other. At a certain age  it s hard to recall. 
But the truly vile do stand way you smirked at me 
when my grandson and granddaughter You love your granddaughter. 
I love my son. I m leaving this wretched 
city as fast as I can If you re half as bright 
as you think you are  I ll never leave my son.

It s the only joy I can Keep going. 
Keep it moving  sad twats how to dig trenches. 
Someone certainly does. You re an anointed knight. 
There s quite a difference. officer in the Lannister army. 
That s like saying I have a bigger cock Lannister forces before long. 
You can be the right hand I lost. We have Lord Edmure. 
Yield the castle or we ll hang him. hiding like a fucking coward. 
Yield the castle or I cut his throat. Ser Jaime. 
We didn t know you were coming. You just allowed   men 
to approach unchallenged. Have Lord Edmure bathed and fed. 
Walder. not prepared to carry out. 
Now let s say I threatened to hit you   What do you think I d do  
  I don t give a rat s... gates  not whatever this is. 
Have your lads start digging is under my command. 
If that s not to your liking  go home. A parley or a fight  
He s an old man. Lady Mormont. 
Welcome to Bear Island. It was said she was a great beauty. 
I m sure you will be  too. or any other kind of beauty. 
She was a great warrior  though. Castle Black  Lady Lyanna. 
He was also a great warrior I think we ve had enough small talk. 
Why are you here  before he marched on 
Winterfell and was killed.   It said... 
  I remember what it said. whose name is Stark. 
Robb is gone  now more than ever. 
I ve come with my sister to ask and Lady Sansa is a Bolton. 
Or is she a Lannister  you don t just want my allegiance. 
You want my fighting men. It is our duty to stop him. 
Even more so because he holds our my lady  is that... 
I understand that I m responsible for Mormont life for someone else s war  
If it please  my lady  All right  Ser Davos of House Seaworth. 
How is it you understand how I feel  Being responsible for so many 
lives at such a young age. then I was a smuggler. 
And now I find myself Your uncle  Lord Commander Mormont  
made that man his steward. he had the courage to do what was right  
even if it meant giving his life. that the real war isn t between 
a few squabbling houses. the dead are coming. 
Is this true  I fought them at Hardhome. 
We both lost. But there s no hiding from this. 
We have to fight and we House Stark for   years. 
We will not break faith today. . 
  We are not a large house  fights with the strength 
of  mainlanders. the Boltons are doomed. 
Kingslayer. You re trespassing. 
In the name of King Tommen  I My nephew s marked for 
death no matter what. You ll force me to storm the castle. 
Hundreds will die. We ll breach them and kill 
every last one of you. On my honor. 
Your honor  the war is not over. 
This is my home. So you can either attack 
or try to starve us out. You clearly have no intention 
of saving your men s lives. And I wanted to see you in 
person  get the measure of you. I m disappointed. 
The answer is no. I could be skinned for 
even talking to you. We sent ravens to Houses Manderly... 
I don t care about ravens. I received you out of 
respect for your father. abandon its ancestral home 
to fight alongside wildlings. I would remind you that House Glover 
is pledged to House Stark. Stark for centuries. 
We wept when we heard castle  he answered Robb s call 
and hailed him King in the North. When they threw my wife 
and children in prison Getting himself and those 
who followed him killed. Why did we have to come here  
Some of us still like it. Doesn t interest you anymore  
I m sorry. I won t joke about it. You think Uncle Euron s hunting for us  
Of course he is. As long as It s a great big world 
and we have fast ships. I don t care what you want. Drink. 
Drink it all. Some bad years  
But I m tired of watching Now listen to me.

Drink. never going back. 
We ll get justice for you. Fuck justice  then. We ll 
get revenge. Drink. there s no coming back

back the Iron Islands. Now  since it s my last night

And that s a good thing  He chose this place for a reason. 
Those mountains are a there for the horses. 
We re not staying here long. as much as the Boltons did. 
We have to march on Winterfell  Hornwoods   Mazins... 
 Mormonts. if we re careful and smart. 
For fuck s sake. men from a  year old  
Ser Davos is the reason I m There s no time. 
If we went down to Castle Friends  this is not worth fighting over  
This ll be it  now.   Who the fuck are you  
  Hold on. All my superiors thought I was brave. 
I wasn t. I mean  I friends would see I was afraid. 
That s all I was  a coward. won t take up arms against us. 
I m your murderer. her son from their hut. 
But we weren t animals. I cut that young boy s throat myself 
as his mother screamed I felt such shame. 
Shame was so heavy on me  the rest of my life. 
Now  I know I can never is bring a little 
goodness into the world. to stop killing people. 
Start helping people. the gods to answer your prayers. 
It s not even about the gods. your prayers yourself. 
Seven save you  friends. Well  we re talking about life. 
You  Who are you protecting us from  
Do you have any horses  Food  then. Protecting the 
people is hungry work. but we have hungry mouths here. 
Stay safe. They follow the Red God. 
Aye  well  all are welcome here. you ve got steel even 
if you say you don t. Kill them  
It d be you against all of them. You do. 
I m done with fighting. You don t cure a disease by 
spreading it to more people. Come on up for some supper. 
It s gonna be a cold night. Might even have some ale hidden away. 
He s not a lying man. What do you care  
I want to book passage home. Why do you care  
We leave in two days. And we ll leave at dawn. 
See you at sunrise. South. 
What are you gonna do  We saw what s out there. 
We know it s coming here.   You swore a vow.   Aye  I pledged 
my life to the Night s Watch. They killed me  Edd  My own brothers. 
You want me to stay here after that  This is good soup. 
Do you remember those kidney  Don t go  you idiot.  
How could we know  I wish I could change everything. 
We were children. I m sure I can t have been great fun. 
Always sulking in the corner   There s nothing to forgive. 
  Forgive me. You d think after thousands of years  
the Night s Watch would have Where will we go  
If I don t watch over you  Father s I can t stay here  not 
after what happened. Should we tell the Boltons 
to pack up and leave  How many wildlings did you save  
They didn t come here to serve me. Bolton remains Warden of the North  
  Sansa. Bran s and Rickon s. 
Wherever they are  it I m tired of fighting. 
It s all I ve done since I left home. I ve killed wildlings. I ve 
killed men that I admire. If we don t take back the 
North  we ll never be safe. My lady. 
Ser Davos. What happened down there

Not long enough to understand. And somehow you ve risen

So it s good news. death of my beloved Aunt Lysa. 
  Ale    What is it  
  Sansa Stark. Don t look  She s sitting with Petyr Baelish. 
Littlefinger  Ten  I think. Too many. 
My Lady  I don t think this is... It gives some men courage. 
Does it give you courage  Lady Sansa. 
My name is Brienne of Tarth. He said  
Your loyalty came free of charge. Lady Sansa. 
Before your mother s death  find you and protect you. 
I will shield your back   I was. 
  Strange. It was after Renly s murder. 
Ah  yes.   But you were accused. 
  By men who did not see what happened. This woman swore to protect Renly  
she failed. Why would I want somebody with your 
history of failure guarding Lady Sansa    if we can have a word alone... 
  No. bowing to the king. 
Neither of us wanted to be there. You should leave. 
We don t want our new friend Why don t you stay  
I m gonna ask you to stay. Stop  stop  stop  stop  
Stop  Yes  my Lady  
You can stand now. I would protect those girls. 
They don t want your protection. Get your horse. 
A summons from the Queen. one I gave to Myrcella. 
It s a threat. by people who hate our family. 
It s a threat  of Oberyn and his sister. 
And every other tragedy that the ground if they touch her. 
Softer. Our daughter is in danger and you re worried 
I am speaking too loudly  You ve never been a father to her. 
If I was a father to any of my children  Our eldest child murdered 
at his own wedding  smirking whore from Highgarden  
I m gonna make things better. And I m bringing our daughter home. 
You can t just ask Prince I m not going to ask him anything. 
You go down there with an army Do you know where they re keeping her  
Oberyn mentioned the Water Gardens. You re going to Dorne. 
A one handed man. No sunflowers. I don t like yellow. 
Roses are very nice  But no flutes. 
I hate flutes. We can have a harp  don t they  
Don t they  They certainly do  my dear. 
They certainly do. I never thought I d end up settling down 
in a place like this. We won t get to live at Stokeworth. 
When mother dies  my sister gets the castle She calls me mean names and sometimes 
even still she pulls my hair I think you re a good person. 
And your sister is a mean person. and if there s one thing I ve learned  
is that meanness comes around. eventually. 
One way or another. Ser Jaime  
Ser Bronn of the Blackwater. This is my betrothed  Lollys. 
A pleasure. When are you planning on getting married  
Just get on with it. There s no way this little visit 
could possibly mean anything good for me. Mmm. 
We ve made a deal  your sister and I. Because you re going to come with me 
and help me with something important. and a much better castle. 
Return from where  The prince does not 
wish to be disturbed. and I ll shove it up your... 
 i Captain...  i  and you sit here 
in the Water Gardens Oberyn was slain 
during a trial by combat   You don t have to remind me. 
He was my brother long The whole country 
would have you go to war. The Sand Snakes are with me. 
They have the love of their people. in your chair doing nothing. 
Oberyn is dead. do they have to kill  
 i Let me have her.  i  I loved my brother. 
And you made him very happy. But we do not mutilate 
little girls for vengeance. And how long would that be  
The Unsullied are too conspicuous. Sons of the Harpy. 
You haven t  have you  they drink  they whore  
fight in streets  Follow people from the taverns 
to nice quiet alleys. You re afraid  
Unsullied fear nothing. You understood fear once  long ago  
but you forgot what it means. Fear is useful that way. 
Sons of the Harpy... On all of our necks. 
Please  Your Grace... I think you should 
exercise restraint... Well  for one thing  he 
may have valuable information. How do you know that  
Because I questioned him. He is born free. 
Why should he want Perhaps the only thing 
that gave him pride  i They pay him.  i  
Great families  afraid to do a thing. And how do you know this  
   i Everyone know this.  i   i We do not know what 
this man did or didn t do.  i  Show all the citizens of Meereen 
that you are better than those Thank you all for your council. 
 i Your Grace...  i  About your father. 
  About the Mad King. of my enemies  lies  
Consider me reminded. I was at his side 
from the first. When the people rose 
and revolted against him and laughed as they screamed  
and his efforts to stamp out dissent the justice he thought they deserved. 
And each time  until the very end. 
I will not have the Son of the Harpy There s a bug. 
Yes  best be careful. When I agreed to come with you  
did I misrepresent my intentions    You don t like it  
  I want to take a walk. to the man who brings her your head. 
She ought to offer her cunt. Well  I suppose a box is as good 
a place for me as anywhere. talking about the 
futility of everything. You said we are going to Meereen. 
What s in Volantis  at the end of the road to Meereen  
I told you. Everywhere has already got a ruler. 
Every pile of shit hanging from it. 
You are quite good  do you know  I didn t rule  I was a servant. 
Still  a man of talent. promise in other areas as well. 
She wanted me I wouldn t go. 
Why  even as a servant. 
People follow leaders I find us repulsive. 
And we find them... with large comfortable boxes 
to keep them away. people like you and me are never 
really satisfied inside the box.   Let s go for a walk. 
  No. to deceive your queen  
Should I throw them Ser Meryn. 
I don t want to dissuade   Thank you  Your Grace. 
  Thanks. Take the head. 
Let me  Your Grace. It could prove 
useful for my work. You heard the man  over there. 
You re the hand of the King. for a woman to assume that role. 
I m merely advising my son until he comes we ll have the time. 
In addition to be Master of Ships  Oh  Your Grace.

That s far more than I must say... 
I can not... better deserves the title. 
That is kind of you to say. Well  the King is very 
busy at this moment. He is learning. 
On this occasion  to speak on his behalf. 
I returned to the capital Small Council with sycophants. 
Sending your own brother away...  i What mission   i  
That is not your concern your authority to dictate 
what is and is not my concern. You would abandon your king 
in his time of need  At Casterly Rock. 
Come on  you know this one. S S Sn...

the Karstarks  and the Manderlys. so we re not doing so well there. 
The Umbers gave Rickon to our enemies. without knowing they had another choice. 
I beg your pardon  my lady  but they can count on them either. 
How well do you know My father always said 
Northerners are different. but how many rose 
up against the Boltons but I know men. 
They re more or less the same in any corner it s a fight they can win. 
There are more than three Mazin  Hornwood. 
Two dozen more. The North remembers. 
They remember the Stark name. I don t doubt it. 
But Jon doesn t have the Stark name. as Ramsay is Roose Bolton s. 
And there are also the Tullys. the Boltons without question. 
I didn t know the Tullys still had an army. The Blackfish is a legend. 
His support would mean a great deal. I ve sworn to protect you  my lady. 
You heard them. We need more men helped a man murder his own brother 
with bloodmagic. Already out looking for a 
leader with better prospects. Jon isn t Davos  the Red Woman 
or Stannis for that matter. Jon is Jon. Then why did you lie to him when he

looking for a horse thief. I hope so. 
Killing crows in the open

You need someone to rebuild and that lord to fight for you

You need him. You see  Ser Davos  
You ve been saved They will come  
Your Grace. want to be conquered. 
You didn t conquer them. their chains. 
No. Mhysa  Mhysa  
Mhysa  Mhysa  Mhysa  Clegane  look into the flames. 
What do you see  The only thing standing 
between us Closest castle to Hardhome

  I believe you know my son. and eunuchs  
What do you think I should do  You saw the dragon

a dragon doesn t to really use them... 
  You re fucked. Dragons are where 
our partnership ends. start spitting fire 
on King s Landing. back in that river. 
I know what Cersei has told you. burn down your homes  
murder you  I m not here to murder  
and all I want to destroy to the benefit of no one but the 
Cersei Lannisters of the world. Together  we will leave the world 
a better place than we found it. Step forward  my lord. 
You will not kneel  and destroyed House Tyrell 
for all time. There are 
no easy choices in war. she was born in Westeros. 
She s lived here all her life. and chose to support 
a foreign invader. at her back. 
You will not trade Perhaps he could take 
the Black  Your Grace. Step back and shut your mouth. 
Who are you  son of Randyll Tarly. 
You are the future great house from the world. 
Don t let it happen again. Your Grace  nothing scrubs 
bold notions from a man s head I m not here 
to put men in chains. I gave them a choice. 
They made it. I m not beheading anyone. 
Your Grace. I  Daenerys of House 
Targaryen  First of My Name  sentence you to die. 
Dracarys. We haven t done 
a full accounting. We have the Tyrell gold  we 
have the Iron Bank behind us. but they ll fight 
if they re well paid  They ll beat any mercenary army. 
They ll beat any army for them  it was sport. 
Her dragon burnt bolts bigger than you. 
They couldn t stop it. So  what do we do  
Sue for peace  and murdered. 
And in her mind  she s winning. Maybe we can count on Tyrion 
to intercede on our behalf He didn t. 
You saw the crossbow  Tyrion didn t kill Joffrey. 
He had nothing to do with it. She confessed before she died. 
And this was before or after After. 
And you believed her  your granddaughter married 
to Joffrey or Tommen  Which one would have made Olenna 
the true ruler her grandchildren  
her whole house. So we fight and die 
or we submit and die. They re beautiful  aren t they  
It wasn t the word Gorgeous beasts. 
They re not beasts to me. to everyone else  
they re my children. from a position of strength. 
Sometimes strength is terrible. in the heart for your people. 
Ser Davos gets carried away. He was a great man. 
You look strong. I return to your 
service  my queen  Ravens. 
We need to send ravens. Prophecies of doom 
are never in short supply  A little timid  
but a sharp mind. claims to have seen 
dead men on the march of a raven with three eyes  
Yes  it is a bit much.   The crippled boy. 
  Do you know him  I saw him go beyond the Wall. 
And  to what he has to say. 
Perhaps you need more scribing is real  they ll believe it. 
If you advise all the lords And if you tell every 
maester in the Citadel about the Long Night  
they may find something It could be done. 
And this news It s also possible 
that this message to lure southern armies away from the 
lands they are currently defending It s real. 
I ve seen it. I promise you we will get to the 
truth of it one way or another. It brings to mind the 
work of Jenny of Oldstones  Don t forget the prophet Lodos  
who promised that the Drowned God would Is he the one whose father and 
brother were just burnt alive  I haven t had the heart 
to tell him yet. The ravenry was falling apart 
the last time I checked. That s why they re rulers. 
She gave Tarly a choice  I can t make 
her decisions for her. It s what I told myself when I 
watched them beg for mercy   screams rose higher   
I m not the one doing it. with the right counsel. 
You need to find a way   Jon Snow. 
Did you read it  What s it say  
Nothing good. I m happy for you. 
You don t look happy. marching towards Eastwatch. 
If they make it past the Wall... I need to go home. 
You said you don t with the men we have. 
Unless you ll join us. she marches in. 
Perhaps not. made up by wet nurses 
to frighten children. the dead at my invitation. 
So bring the dead to her. The first wight I ever saw 
was brought into Castle unless Cersei 
grants us an audience but if the gold cloaks 
were to recognize you  Well  it will all be for nothing 
if we don t have How do you propose to find one  
With the queen s permission  cure so I could serve you. 
Allow me to serve you. better than anyone. 
They won t follow Ser Jorah. beyond the Wall. 
You re not in the Night s Watch who s fought them. 
I m the only one here permission to leave. 
With respect  Your Grace  And I came here 
knowing that you could I put my trust 
in you  a stranger  for all our people. 
Now I m asking you But perhaps we should have. 
The Knights of the Vale came You are very kind  my lords. 
But Jon is our king. He didn t. He trusted 
you to hold it for him. Don t do that. 
  What  They made you feel 
better than everyone. and you sat there and listened. 
I listened to their complaints  Their opinions 
are important to you. Offend them 
and Jon loses his army. heads is very satisfying  
but that s not the way you you ll need their support... 
so you can work together How can you even think 
such a horrible thing  but the thought 
just won t go away. Last time I was here  I killed 
my father with a crossbow. There s a path to the left 
that hugs the cliff. Too many steps. 
You re not staying here  What if someone takes the boat  
Then we re fucked. We should be preparing 
the city for a siege. for you to train. 
Unless you plan on fighting you a bit of trouble as well. 
And here I am  ready to train. I kill you by accident. 
Oh  you won t be I needed to see you. 
And I knew you d like a complete fool. 
I thought I d surprise you three steps ahead of me. 
Abandoned the family home    Don t talk about Father. 
  Listen to me   again  I d cut you in half. 
It ll take you a while He knew I was innocent. 
He didn t hate me because of what I am. 
A little monster   What do you want   
Daenerys will win this war. no way around that. 
Daenerys is not her father. if Cersei agrees 
to certain terms. you can ask her yourself. 
I   I don t. She has a more 
important request. still be rowing. 
I looked in shops  straight to the Street of Steel. 
Aren t you worried Why should they recognize me  
Sometimes I hardly do. Anybody give you any trouble  
Here I am  arming Lannisters  Safest place for me was 
right under the queen s nose. state of affairs. 
Bad things are coming. Well  the thing you need to 
understand is     Let s go. 
You should know that killed my father  
The family that I never knew what for  
but I ve always known one of those swords. 
I don t know much this I know. 
Keep your father s name enough already. 
Well  who should I say I am    someone s going to   
  You there    Still five gold dragons  
  Are you joking    . 
Apiece. What s in the boat  
Not more gold.   I like wine. 
  Or hams. A man thinks he s done. 
He s ready to go back his breeches up  
his lady of the hour pops a tiny he s back in the race. 
Here  have a taste. or you ll put a hole 
in that chainmail. until you see how 
the first bite hits you. Fish hook. Some men 
you just can t teach. Perhaps there s 
some arrangement  more than Queen Cersei   
This is Gendry. I could give you something. 
That won t be necessary. have to say  
Daenerys wants to meet. She s just won a great victory. 
Why would she want a truce now  Do you think 
anything of importance You let it happen. 
Why  with the Dragon Queen 
could be in our beat her  we have to be clever. 
We have to fight her and Dragon Queens... 
Whatever stands in our way  for this. 
Who will you say is the father  Do you remember what Father 
used to say about people  Never betray me again. 
We re leaving today. He doesn t need to be thinking about 
harboring the bastard of a dead king. a smith who s come 
to pay his respects Understood. 
Begging your pardon  Your Grace. Grace  this is Clo   
Name s Gendry  Your Grace. He was meant 
to keep that to himself. I saw your father once 
at Winterfell.   And you re a lot shorter. 
I grew up on stories about them. Ser Davos told me where you re 
going  Your Grace  and why. You know how to use one  
Well  that s a problem. We could use the help. 
As my father used to say  than dead for 
the rest of your life.  But if what you said is true 
about what s up there  All I ve ever done 
is live to a ripe old age. the slaver gave me 
when I suggested he free us the rest of our lives. 
Take it with you. We should be better 
at saying farewell by now. you won t have to deal 
with the King I wish you good fortune in the 
wars to come  Your Grace. steps there are in the Citadel  
No. in the Great Sept of Baelor. 
None anymore. he recorded everything. 
He even recorded It s when a man

Steps. you want to do this  
You always wanted the achievements of better men. 
I found it  my lord. are very thorough. 
You re sure this is the Lady Stark thanks you 
for your service. of stupid fucking 
ideas like this  How many queens are there now  
Two. or the one who 
fucks her brother  Not enough. 
The big woman    Hmm. 
  I ll be staying behind. You are. 
You really want to go out there  You re the Hound. 
I saw you once at Winterfell. Don t trust him. 
Don t trust any of them. their lord told them to do 
was sell me to a red witch I hardly recognized you. 
Ser Jorah Mormont. I haven t been feeling 
like myself. He was my father. 
He hunted us like animals. Here we all are 
at the edge of the world for the same reason. 
Our reasons aren t your reasons. There s a greater 
purpose at work. We may take the steps  
but the Lord of Light   Are we coming with you or not  
Don t you want to know freezing cell  waiting to die  
He s right. We re all breathing. 
Jon  You alright  ..Beautiful  eh  
I can breathe again. from freezing off  
Tormund  You ve got to keep moving  fighting s better  
..fucking s best. Tormund  We ve got to make due with what we ve got. 
Tormund  This one is maybe not so smart. ...That s more important than being smart. 
...Smart people don t come here And  
Jon  She will only fight beside us Now you don t like kneeling. 
...Mance Rayder was a great man. How many of his people died 
for his pride  Thoros  A priestess. 
..I ll admit it  it is a subtle distinction. You know what she did to me  
She struck me down on the bed  Gendry  And put leeches on me  
Hound  Was she naked too  Hound  Could ve been worse. 
Gendry to Hound   She wanted to kill me. ..So what you winging about  
Gendry  I m not winging. This one has been killed six times and 
you don t hear him bitching about it. was with your father. 
He was a good man. I was a prisoner of the wildlings. 
But we avenged him. Can t think of a worse way for him to go. 
The Night s Watch was his life. He would And he died on the executioner s block. 
Your father wanted to execute me  It was in the right  of course. 
Didn t make me hate him any less. But you are back. 
And it s been in your family for centuries. I m not his son. 
I brought shame onto my house. It s yours. 
May it serve you well. One times the boys were 
shooting arrows with Ser Rodrick  and with no one around  just like now. 
No one to stop me. one arrow and walk back and shoot it again. 
I wasn t very good. I don t remember. 
But I hit the bull s eye. And he was standing right here  
smiling down on me. but he was smiling  so I 
knew it wasn t wrong. to be doing and he knew it. 
Now he s dead. What  
That s your pretty handwriting. Robb  
I write to you today with heavy heart.   You don t have to read it. 
  I remember. against my beloved Joffrey 
and tried to steal his throne. I beg you  come to King s Landing  
swear fealty to King Joffrey Your faithful sister  Sansa. 
  They forced me to do it. Did they put you in a rack and stretched 
you till your bones started to crack  So was I. 
I would have let them kill me dragged father to the block. 
I remember the pretty dress you were   I was there. 
Standing in the crown near Baelor s statue. Did you fight with the 
Lannisters and save father    Just like me. 
  I didn t betray him. I didn t betray Robb. You should be on your knees thanking me. 
We re standing in Winterfell back  he lost the Battle of the Bastards. 
The Knights of the Vale won the battle   I was training. 
  Training  Oh  I didn t know that and 
I can imagine quite a lot. I guess we ll never know. 
What are you going to do with that letter  Where did you find it  
You re scared  aren t you  No one s gonna hang you. 
You re scared I ll show it to Jon Not  that s not Jon. 
He ll understand  Do you know how happy Cersei would 
be right now if she saw us fighting  You are scared the Northern 
lords will read it. Fuck off. 
They told me you were mean. I don t give two shits about wildlings. 
Gingers  I hate. Just like you. 
Don t point your fucking finger at me. I didn t trip  I was pushed. 
Ever since  you ve been mean. You have sad eyes. 
You want to suck my dick  is that it  Ah  dick. 
I like it. I have a beauty waiting for 
me back in Winterfell. blue eyes. 
Tallest woman you ve ever seen. How does she look at you  
Like she wants to carve you We ve met. 
I want to make babies with her. They conquer the world. 
How did a mad fucker like you   You don t look much like him. 
  Who s that  You knew him  
Of course I did. Your wildlings then told me the Red Woman 
brought you back.   I don t know. 
That s all anyone can tell me. We re soldiers. 
We have to know what we re fighting for. So what are you fighting for  
Life. And the last. 
But we all die. That s all I know. 
You and I won t find much We can defend those who 
can t defend themselves. Maybe we don t need to 
understand anymore than that. Maybe that s enough. 
That s what I saw in the fire. We re getting close. 
Do you know what I like about you  Oh. 
I ve been heroic on occasion. I don t want you to be a hero. 
Heroes do stupid things and they die. Jon Snow. 
They all try to outdo each other. Drogo  Jorah  
Daarios  even this... Jon Snow is not in love with me. 
Oh  my mistake. He s too little for me. 
I didn t mean... I wouldn t have chosen a coward as my Hand. 
So... From everything you ve told me about her 
she d rather murder me than speak. horrible way  then she d murder you. 
Nobody trusts my sister less than I do  we ll go with two armies  
we ll go with three dragons  to the foundation stone. 
And right now she s thinking If we want to create a 
new and better world  But fear is all Cersei has. 
It s all my father had... Because everyone beneath 
them longs to see them dead. He did. 
But you once spoke to me If that s the kind of queen you want to be  
how are you different from all the My brother promised me he d keep 
a grip on the Lannister forces. Except yours. 
And I promised him something provocative. 
And  That was necessary. 
  Perhaps. to die and not the son. 
Perhaps they both needed time to contemplate before you ended their possibilities. 
One can be forgiven for thinking you re You need to take your enemy s side  
if you re going to see the things they do. respond effectively and beat them. 
Which I want you to do very much. But the world you want to build 
doesn t get build all at once. After you break the wheel  how 
do we make sure it stays broken  The Iron born folk  
among their many flaws... Your Grace  I saw hundreds of arrows fly towards

You ve been thinking about my for the short term  
we wouldn t have lost Dorne and Highgarden. A bear. 
We can fuck her Aye. 
You did.   Where did she get it  
  I don t know. We re asking   men to fight with us

Many of them will be happy to Their loyalty is to Jon. 
Jon is not here. I haven t The King chose you to rule in his absence. 
And rule you have. They say that  they respect you. 
Some may even prefer you. and then they named him their king and now 
they re ready to turn their backs on him again. If they found out I wrote that letter...

Some of the lads told me Alright. 
It was a proper scrap. You were waving that flaming sword. 
I thought you were the bravest man Where s the rest of them  
If we wait long enough Get a raven to Daenerys  
tell her what s happened. Go  Now  
You re faster without the hammer. Stop  
Go  Raven. 
We need to send the raven. Come to us in our darkness and 
lead your servant into the light. Unless the Lord of Light is kind 
enough to send us a bit of fire. Why  
Maybe he was the one who turned them.   No. 
We need to take that thing back with us. No. 
There s another. You don t understand. 
The Lord brought you back... Milady. 
Milady.   Milady  you are the Lady of Winterfell. 
  I am. They invited you  they want you there. 
I will not set foot in King s Landing while they can come and take me. 
Until then  I ll remain where I belong. Ser Jaime will be there. 
You said he treated you honourably before. you with Littlefinger. 
I have many guards who d happily And you trust their loyalty

with the others  the last thing I want. 
I don t know trying to guess. 
When I was still a boy   I traveled with a group 
of actors through the free cities. The same is true 
at court. My role is to be sly  obsequious 
and without scruples. Huh. 
Can you free me from this pit  No. 
As I said  Tell me. 
No riddles  no stories   Did you know that 
your son is marching south fighting for 
his father s freedom. Boys have been 
conquerors before. is the King s   
the late King s brother. he is a proven battle commander 
and he is utterly without mercy. The Throne 
is his by rights. use to her than a dead one. 
You want me to serve the who crippled my son  
I want you your vile treason  
tell your son as the true heir. 
Cersei knows you some precious thing to me  
That I would trade my honor You grew up with actors. 
You learned their craft with soldiers. 
I learned how to die  i Such a pity.  i  
What of your  i thing to you   i  
It s a birthday message would have you think. 
Keep shooting them down. and you ll never be surprised. 
Look. How long before 
they take his head  Not in time. Tywin Lannister 
marches north as we speak. and for  years they have never 
failed to exact their toll. Enter the Twins alone 
and he ll sell you to the Lannis. My father would do whatever 
it took to secure our crossing. to lead this army  
I can t have other men   I ll go. 
  Theon   i You can t   i  He would never 
harm me. What do you want  
It is a great pleasure to see you Your boy s too proud 
to come before me himself. Father  you forget yourself. 
Lady Stark is here   not until I die. 
Do I look dead to you  from you  bastard

And her honey s all mine. Huh. Your father didn t 
come to the wedding.   My Lord  I   
  Don t deny it. You know it s true. I needed to get rid 
of sons and daughters. you would see that he has 
  men outside your walls. Don t try and frighten me  
Lady Stark. and your son s got no fur 
to keep his balls warm. Oh yes  I said some words... 
And I swore oaths to the crown too  which makes your boy 
and his corpses to be nothing the Gods gave a fish  
I d hand you both   Stark  Tully  
Lannister  Baratheon  a single thought on any of you  
 i And... engage.   Soon  he says. 
  Good. I thought a wolf was 
more appropriate for you It was my father s sword  
his father before him. but he had the grace 
to leave the sword I wouldn t be standing here if it 
wasn t for you and your beast. So you ll take it. 
I ll hear no more about it. Right. 
Now don t think this means with you 
and Alliser Thorne. a man to wield it. 
I ll apologize I sent him to King s Landing 
yesterday. That should get young 
Joffrey s attention. between you and Thorne. 
Now go and put your sword my supper.

Then Lord Stark so strong. 
What is honor  i And what is duty  i  
 i against the feel of a newborn son  i  Sam told you. 
We re all human. Honor comes easy then.

And  Wall when no one else could. 
Not the Night s Watch  to what he has to say. 
Perhaps you need more scribing proposal is forthcoming  
Everyone in Westeros is real  they ll believe it. 
If you advise all the lords And if you tell every 
maester in the Citadel about the Long Night  
they may find something It s also possible 
that this message to lure southern armies away from the 
lands they are currently defending That does seem far more likely 
than magic birds It s real. 
I ve seen it. I promise you we will get to the 
truth of it one way or another. Don t forget the prophet Lodos  
who promised that the Drowned God would I haven t had the heart 
to tell him yet. The ravenry was falling apart 
the last time I checked. That s why they re rulers. 
She gave Tarly a choice  What else could she do  
Not burn him alive I can t make 
her decisions for her. I found the traitors  but I wasn t 
the one burning them alive. It s what I told myself when I 
watched them beg for mercy   screams rose higher   
I m not the one doing it. flesh filled the throne room   
I m not the one doing it. with the right counsel. 
You need to find a way   Jon Snow. 
Did you read it  What s it say  
Nothing good. I m happy for you. 
You don t look happy. marching towards Eastwatch. 
If they make it past the Wall... I need to go home. 
You said you don t with the men we have. 
Unless you ll join us. made up by wet nurses 
to frighten children. the dead at my invitation. 
So bring the dead to her. We don t have to 
bring the whole army. The first wight I ever saw 
was brought into Castle unless Cersei 
grants us an audience the moment we set foot 
in the capital. He might listen to me. 
And how would you get Well  it will all be for nothing 
if we don t have How do you propose to find one  
With the queen s permission  cure so I could serve you. 
Allow me to serve you. better than anyone. 
They won t follow Ser Jorah. beyond the Wall. 
You re not in the Night s Watch permission to leave. 
With respect  Your Grace  And I came here 
knowing that you could I put my trust 
in you  a stranger  for all our people. 
Now I m asking you The King in the North 
should stay in the North. You are very kind  my lords. 
But Jon is our king. I warned Jon this would happen. 
That he couldn t leave the North He didn t. He trusted 
you to hold it for him. These are Mother 
and Father s chambers. Don t do that. 
  What  They made you feel 
better than everyone. and you sat there and listened. 
I listened to their complaints  Their opinions 
are important to you. Offend them 
and Jon loses his army. Winterfell didn t just 
fall into our hands. and the Hornwoods 
and the wildlings and the Vale. heads is very satisfying  
but that s not the way you you ll need their support... 
so you can work together How can you even think 
such a horrible thing  but the thought 
just won t go away. Last time I was here  I killed 
my father with a crossbow. There s a path to the left 
that hugs the cliff. Too many steps. 
You re not staying here  What if someone takes the boat  
Then we re fucked. We should be preparing 
the city for a siege. for you to train. 
Unless you plan on fighting you a bit of trouble as well. 
And here I am  ready to train. you want people to see 
how you look swinging I needed to see you. 
And I knew you d like a complete fool. 
I thought I d surprise you three steps ahead of me. 
Abandoned the family home  again  I d cut you in half. 
It ll take you a while because of what I am. 
A little monster did he think   
did he think I wanted   What do you want   
Daenerys will win this war. no way around that. 
Daenerys is not her father. if Cersei agrees 
to certain terms. you can ask her yourself. 
I   I don t. She has a more 
important request. straight to the Street of Steel. 
Aren t you worried Why should they recognize me  
Sometimes I hardly do. Anybody give you any trouble  
Here I am  arming Lannisters  Safest place for me was 
right under the queen s nose. Well  the thing you need to 
understand is   that killed my father  
The family that I never knew what for  
but I ve always known one of those swords. 
I don t know much this I know. 
Keep your father s name enough already. 
Well  who should I say I am    someone s going to   
  You there  What can I do for you  
  Is that your boat    That they are. 
I try to stay away from them   Still five gold dragons  
  Are you joking    . 
Apiece. What s in the boat  
Not more gold.   I like wine. 
  Or hams.   What  
Fermented crab. A man thinks he s done. 
He s ready to go back his breeches up  
his lady of the hour pops a tiny or you ll put a hole 
in that chainmail. until you see how 
the first bite hits you. Fish hook. Some men 
you just can t teach. Perhaps there s 
some arrangement  I could give you something. 
That won t be necessary. He s the Hand of the Queen. 
Why are you here  have to say  
Daenerys wants to meet. She s just won a great victory. 
Why would she want a truce now  on the Seven Kingdoms. 
Tyrion claims he ll have proof. Bronn. 
He betrayed you. Do you think 
anything of importance You let it happen. 
Why  with the Dragon Queen 
could be in our beat her  we have to be clever. 
We have to fight her and Dragon Queens... 
Whatever stands in our way  for this. 
Who will you say is the father  Do you remember what Father 
used to say about people  He doesn t need to be thinking about 
harboring the bastard of a dead king. a smith who s come 
to pay his respects Understood. 
Begging your pardon  Your Grace. Grace  this is Clo   
Name s Gendry  Your Grace. He was meant 
to keep that to himself. I saw your father once 
at Winterfell.   And you re a lot shorter. 
I grew up on stories about them. Ser Davos told me where you re 
going  Your Grace  and why. You re not a soldier. 
No  but I m a fighter. You know how to use one  
Well  that s a problem. We could use the help.

the rest of your life.  All I ve ever done

The big woman    Hmm. 
  I ll be staying behind. You are. 
You really want to go out there  My scouts found them 
a mile south of the Wall. You re the Hound. 
I saw you once at Winterfell. We don t want to go beyond 
the Wall  we have to. their lord told them to do 
was sell me to a red witch I hardly recognized you. 
Ser Jorah Mormont. I haven t been feeling 
like myself. He was my father. 
He hunted us like animals. Here we all are 
at the edge of the world for the same reason. 
Our reasons aren t your reasons. There s a greater 
purpose at work. We may take the steps  
but the Lord of Light   Are we coming with you or not  
Don t you want to know We re all breathing.

It s no wonder she s so protective of you. The first days of marriage 
are often so blissful. Do you think she s intelligent  
I can t quite tell. There s nothing for me in Casterly Rock. 
That s where you grew up. You said that King s Landing

You loved your family. We don t. 
We go around.   Doesn t matter. 
I know where they re going. He hates that nickname. 
Well  he s not here to during the War of the Five Kings. 
One night    He borrowed it  
  He wasn t a thief. I was drunk too. 
He gave me half the ham. under a wagon  with the ham 
bone still in his hand. but Lord Tywin heard my 
family name was Payne  to squire for his son. 
Punishment  Lord Tyrion was always very good to me.

such a nasty person. You beat The Hound. 
I m proud to be your squire. with the sword twice a day  
before we ride in the morning and how to ride properly. 
Thank you. I suppose that s more important. 
You weren t a knight  but I was. 
Lord Tyrion said he was a good man. When I was a girl  
my father held a ball. He invited dozens of young lords to Tarth. 
I didn t want to go  but he dragged me None of the boys noticed 
how mulish and tall I was. I d never been so happy. 
Till I saw a few of the boys sniggering. They were toying with me. 
Brienne the Beauty  they called me. ugliest girl alive. 
A great lumbering beast. Don t let them see your tears  he told me. 
The nasty little shits  He danced with me and none of the 
other boys could say a word. Lord Tyrion said he was... 
Yes  Pod  he liked men  he danced with me because he was kind 
and he wouldn t see me hurt. until his last day. 
And I couldn t save him in return. One day  I will avenge King Renly. 
But you said a shadow murdered him. of Stannis Baratheon. 
I know it was Stannis. And a man...

I won t try to persuade you. at Castle Black  
Are you bored of us already  But it s a question of survival. 
Night s Watch can t continue to feed your men I know it. 
We march on Winterfell within a fortnight. They d rather burn than fight for me  
so be it. that s the safest course. 
Or you could see if this Tormund fellow I assume the brothers of the Night s Watch 
would rather see the wildlings dead. Alliser Thorne elsewhere  
Give him command of Eastwach by the Sea. Whoever said that didn t have many enemies. 
He sees something in you. I m sorry I disappointed him.

First Builder Yarwyck and I have decided oversee this crucial task. 
Brian. You have more experience 
than any other ranger at Castle Black. from the wildling attack. 
I name you First Ranger. Greyguard is a ruin. 
Yes  the fort is in a sorry state. I was charged with the defense of 
King s Landing Keep your ruin. 
Alright  alright. That was a command  not an offer.

Your Grace  Grandmaester  As the High Septon of 
the Faith of the Seven servant in this world. 
An insult to me is an insult to the Gods. You were assaulted  
I was. And they humiliated me  they... 
they beat me  they left me naked I heard this all began in 
Littlefinger s brothel. I tend to both the highest born 
and the lowliest amongst us. So you were administering to the 
needs of these devout prostitutes  What do you want from us  High Septon  
Justice  and throw them in the black cells. 
I ask that you execute their leader  good idea  Your Grace. 
Nonsense  Ser Meryn. Seven blessings... 
Thank the Gods. The young man said I would find the

So  it s meant to... The notion that we are all 
equal in the eyes of Seven   Seven blessings to you. 
  Seven blessings to you  my dear. Far easier than hers. 
Why no shoes  We all do that. 
It stops us from forgetting They think I m special for telling them so. 
Perhaps they re right. The Gods sent you here to tempt me  
I hope not. For that incident with the High Septon. 
An unacceptable way to treat with the blade. 
The High Septon came to speak to me today. I wouldn t presume to know 
your thoughts on the matter. The High Septon s behaviour was corosive  
as was his attitude. So now he resides in the Red 
Keep s dungeons instead. If one collapses  so does the other. 
You must do everything necessary   How s your work coming along  
  Very well. Still a way to go  but... 
Very good. I ll leave you to it then. I hope I can make her happy. 
I hope so too. She suffered enough. 
I ll never hurt her. Which makes you quite a rare thing  
as lords go.   And you re not anymore. 
Allow me a moment alone with And thank you  Lord Baelish. 
I m forever in your debt. I assure you she s still a virgin. 
Tyrion never consumated the marriage. By I leave that to the brothel keeper. 
It s her name I need  not her virtue. When the Lannisters hear I ve 
wed Sansa Stark to Ramsay. Tywin is dead. 
He kept his house in power Jaime has one hand and no allies  
Tommen is a soft boy  Queen Margaery adores Sansa. 
Cersei is Queen Mother  You noticed  still as friends 
men in important places  from Cersei Lannister. 
A rider arrived from Eyrie  you re still in the Vale. 
A message for me  you say. Lannisters made you one of 
the great lords of Westeros. Why gamble with your position  
Every ambitious move is a gamble. It appears that your gamble paid off. 
You re Warden of the North. The Eyrie is mine. 
The last time the lords of the Eyrie formed this world has ever known. 
I d like to borrow one of your birds. I have to get out of this wheelhouse. 
Volantis is a large city. increases a hundred fold. 
I have to get out of this wheelhouse. I will not be of any use

It s a perfectly good face. you ll lose more than... 
Look  we are thousands One more drunk dwarf. 
We have to go now. Come on.   Yes. 
The Volantene masters are very organized. Tears for whores.

to suck a dwarf s cock. Thank you.

  Hello. Do I look like a man without money  
Never trust looks. But who needs wealth when 
you can make a woman laugh    You re just saying that. 
You know how to spot a liar. Why  
Because you have a skeptical mind. I m not.

  You re right  Jon Snow was my Lord Commander. 
I had no love for him. Loyalty is the foundation 
on which the Night s Watch is built. we have all given our lives 
to the Night s Watch.  i He let the wildlings 
through our gates  i  He gave them the very land 
on which they reaved what he thought was right  
I ve no doubt about that. He thrust a terrible choice upon us. 
And we made it. Davos   i He ll have

I don t care who s sitting And those fuckers butchered him. 
Now we return the favor. wanted his friends to die for nothing.

Thorne with us when we go.   Not if we have help.

 i Although this is TV   i   i It s the most 
successful TV show in the world right now.  i   i Today we re 
shooting in Croatia   i  in Seville down in Spain.  i  
 i Whatever hand you re dealt   i   i I think we re 
the only ones in the world  i   i all season long.  i  
 i If one of those spokes  i  How are you all  
 i My name is Duncan Muggoch  i   i or what we also call  i  
 i the southern locations for  i I did Croatia last year.  i  
And this year we ve obviously got both of them this year. 
And even though last year was  i I m one of the producers on  Game of Thrones.   i  
I fulfill a function here of As this is going on here  
over in Spain He s new to this year  so he doesn t 
know quite how manic it can get. on this show. 
The production booklets  left before everybody arrives.  i  
 i And then two days later   i  stress level is not increasing   i  
 i because obviously this is  i we want to please everybody.  i  
 i We want to do a great job.  i  from filming in Belfast  i  
 i  cause the logistics over here  i   i problems of Dubrovnik  i  
 i is it s such a tight   i  vehicles actually into the town  i  
 i just  cause the streets  i  challenges that we face  i  
filming in a city like this.  i so everything has  i  
 i to get taken by Sherpas  i   i one of the furthest and trickiest 
you could get to in the whole city.  i  and this is never go up empty handed 
or come down empty handed. Hello  gorgeous. 
Good. Good  good.  i a full crew rehearsal   i  
 i which is when they ll place where the cameras has finished in Croatia. 
Do that. Just growl at one point. are setting up to do their first scene 
this season in Dany s penthouse.  i So it s right at the 
beginning of the   season five  i  of what s going on in Meereen 
under her new rule. I ve decided 
I will not have them  I have shot mostly in Belfast. 
I have shot several days in Seville. 
Teach them a better way.  i Moving to a foreign 
country on this show  i   i when you walk on the set  i  
 i is that you see familiar faces.  i  because she s come from Croatia  
so we re matching continuity  i so that we can do the same  i  
 i as they ve been doing.  i  so it s imperative 
that things like wigs  and that every member of the team 
is aware of what the look is  we know exactly what we re 
doing and there s no mess ups  i Let s do one 
for camera  please.  i  So the only thing 
that gave him pride   Morning  Duncan. Morning  Mr. Muggoch. 
  Morning. Peter Welter  
Yeah  no  I m talking with him.  i As far as I m concerned  
Bernie is  Game of Thrones.   i  She s an incredible woman 
to work for  actually   i everything together.  i  
And do they want to That s   
I m checking on. David and Dan are obviously   you 
know  they re the creators of it.  i this show running.  i  
Sometimes David and Dan give their notes on the scene  
and then a lot of times we re with  episodes  
that we re constantly prepping. right into the amazing Hardhome. 
 i I usually have a me starting to come towards them 
and open my book to start  i collaborative with all of us.  i  
Today  they re having a big   Yes. Yeah. 
 i When we re shooting  i communication  i  
 i between the producers  i  over to Spain early. 
You re staying here to Sevilla  
 i We are  yes  but I m going I ll go on the charter 
this time. You can have Bernie s seat. 
In a week  we will all to go off of for that. 
 i We re in the  i which are palaces built  i  
 i by Peter the Horrible  i  that s just come into the show    i  
 i it was introduced  i   i really see it    i  
 i now in the fifth season   i  Good morning once again. 
 i It is difficult not built as a set  
but built for a purpose  in the balcony  for instance  
I mean  you can t possibly  i platforms    i  
 i in order to haul  i    Okay. 
 i It s not like  i  shooting day is up here. 
And then we move down garden  I m assuming  
As far as you told me  we have the   It s pretty amazing. 
 i  They have  like  an average just for us is just a privilege.  i  
Wherever you go  there s always both culturally and logistically. 
We ll have to find a compromise We re the foreigners 
coming into their country   i which they always are    i  
 i but our crew are very careful  i  doing for us is unique as well. 
It s never been locked off and check the others  
  Sure.   Because I think village called Magheramorne 
in which there is a quarry that s  i we built the set  i  
 i of Castle Black there.  i   i in season two we built the 
battlements of King s Landing  i   i It s still standing  although it s 
looking a bit worn these days.  i   i The set that we see down here   i  
 i it s a fishing village that is  i establishment.  i  
It was designed to be  i So we needed the water   i  
 i which is why we put it  i  The fantastic thing 
about the Hardhome set  i that what we get to do  i  
 i is create a fishing village  i   i It s Hardhome.  i  
 i What we ve been doing  i   i out in Magheramorne  i  
and created what we need a lot of action takes place. 
 i And then we have  i  that exists in Magheramorne.  i  
And so through having those this sort of tent city 
 i that will be created out there.  i  which is to hold onto that shot. 
 i The director can  i the set and start mapping out  i  
 i where all the things that  i   i  Well  could I put the door  i  
 i in the hut over here    i  Good  so  yeah  
we good with this    shall we have a look...   Look at this edge 
here and see if that works. and what you mustn t do 
is get put off It must be like parachuting. 
Don t worry about the parachute works. 
It doesn t have to be a sparrow. and then everything 
that goes with that   i costume people that have  i  
 i to deal with all of that.  i   i And then just in conjunction  i  
 i with hair and makeup   i  And then everybody 
travelled to set about   your blankets off  guys  
 i so we can look  i   i and he s now going  i  
 i to select the extras  i  Yep  this gentleman. 
And one other lady. a bit poorer than 
we d originally intended. A bit of the teeth black  you 
know  just one or two of those. Just a little less healthy. 
And so it was a bit of a bit poorer than they had done. 
 i And it s still happening.  i  We had more than 
  applications People from 
not only all over Spain   i of  Game of Thrones.   i  
  Hello.   Peter. i  Buenos d as.  i  
  i  Buenos d as.  i    i  Buenas tardes  i  is the afternoon. 
Maybe you just got up.   Thank you. 
There s gonna be about   such a major operation   i  
 i we re doing something like    males  females  in and out. 
We do guards  slaves. Hello  slave.  i  
 i They process down here  i  or four different places 
all straight after each other. all ready for a camera 
that moves behind us. are just smooth. 
 i We ve got Lena Headey from episode three 
 i  which is a kind of  i   i And it s a scene  i  
 i where Cersei is looking  i   i who is a whole new character.  i  
We ve got a beautiful courtyard And we are disguising it 
with a lot of awnings  i And it s supposed to be  i  
 i a really shocking place  i  that she has managed to ignore 
for most of her time   i  There s no...  i  
  i  No jiggling   i  like  Jingle Bells.  
So I can t actually move.  i From walking about  
we re in every street there is.  i  Dubrovnik is understandably 
a big tourist attraction   i That s been a difficulty  i  
 i on the sets.  i    i  Roll camera.  i  
  i  Rolling   i    take one  C marker only. 
 i And  action   i  Nonsense  Ser Meryn. These 
are deeply religious people.  i   Cut. Cut.  i  
 i   Cut   i  Are you all right  
  Wanker. Fuck you. Go on. 
You get into the fucking pelican.    cause it s like a T rex. 
  Hit me  come on. Come on  harder. 
Come on  harder.  i  minutes out of the city  i  
 i and you re in the heart  i   i feel of the show  i  
 i that the landscape has  i   i And everything has that ancient 
feel to it no matter where you go.  i  and the moorlands certainly 
look old  you know.  i because that s been my heart.  i  
 i This is my  year  i   i been in making a film.  i  
 i I ve always loved the set.  i  by the way Chris is standing and 
looking at everyone around set.  i and think if it s looking very 
long  we must be in trouble   i  something entirely different. 
I always find him this massive  epic show. 
 i We shoot  i we do shoot two units   i  
 i so you double it.  i  Today on set I m mostly 
concerned with the Valyrian.  i Let s roll cameras  please.  i  
 i Rolling.  i  Their own people did. 
Find the men who did this   And cut it. 
Let s go one more time. are in a town called Osuna.  i  
 i And it has this  i   i monument as well.  i  
 i When we walked  i  they were looking for. 
 i The stone is quite similar to the   Yes. 
 i This does not  i completely different   i  
 i and that s why we need to of things added to that. 
 i We re shooting just one  i   i It s quite complex.  i  
 i There s a lot of action happening to meet the expectancies 
of what is involved in there. thank you very much. 
That s a wrap for today.  i clear the lights  the equipment.  i  
 i Here was a very stable   i  And then  of course  we had the big 
trip out to see the set of Hardhome  i which will continue to be  i  
 i looked at in weeks to come.  i   i which is always  i  
 i my goal of the day  i  every day of filming. 
And knowing that  i    So it doesn t stop   i  
No  it doesn t stop  no. Not having shot with 
any of the crew before   Hello  Croatia. 
 i    Hello  Spain.  i  shooting date is moving closer  i  
 i and everybody is aware  i  yeah  stress level 
is increasing.  i Production 
arriving in the past  days  i   i of people rolling up.  i  
 i There s probably  people  i  roll cameras  please.  i  
 i   Rolling   i   i The first day of 
shooting is always crucial to us  i  in order to prepare it 
was the right thing. This year  Belfast has got 
some big sets like Hardhome  i of turning what was a notion  i  
 i into reality.  i    If your father   
  He ll never know we re gone. to be afraid of my father.

on tearing us apart. him for years. 
This is exactly what they want. is out there somewhere drawing breath. 
Did you set him free  of action  aren t you

We ve got to make due with what we ve got. So  you ve met this Dragon queen  huh  
And  You spent too much time with the Free Folk. 
Now you don t like kneeling.   You sold me to a witch. 
  A priestess.   Wars cost money. 
  I wanted to be one of you. Like a slave. 
You know what she did to me  Sounds alright so far... 
And put leeches on me    Yes  thank you  I know that. 
  Could ve been worse. about something. That s winging. 
This one has been killed six times and The first time I went north of the Wall  
was with your father. Were you with him at the end  
I was a prisoner of the wildlings. every mutineer found justice. 
Can t think of a worse way for him to go. And they butchered him. 
I hate that he died that way. He was good  all the way through. 
And he died on the executioner s block. He gave it to you. 
I m not his son. I forfeited the right to claim his sword. 
It s yours. Father used to watch us from up here. 
He wouldn t say much. I remember. 
One times the boys were and Bran had left his bow behind  
just lying on the ground. There was one arrow in the target 
and with no one around  just like now. And every shot I had to go up there and get my 
one arrow and walk back and shoot it again. Could ve been the  shot. Or the . 
I don t remember. I looked up. 
And he was standing right here  was against the rules 
but he was smiling  so I I was doing what I was meant 
to be doing and he knew it. With your help. 
What  cause I couldn t write as well as you. 
Robb    Killed from wounds he took in a bull... 
  You don t have to read it. great houses of Lannister and Stark 
Your faithful sister  Sansa. I was a child. 
So was I. They told me it was the 
only way to save father. with Joffrey and Cersei when they 
dragged father to the block.   You were there. 
  I was there. come running to the rescue  
Did you fight with the   But you didn t. 
  Just like me. You didn t win it back  Jon didn t win it 
back  he lost the Battle of the Bastards. While you were where  Travelling the world  
  I was training. suffered things you can never imagine. 
Oh  I didn t know that and survived what I survived. 
I guess we ll never know. Who did you show it to  
Where did you find it  You didn t commit any crimes. 
No one s gonna hang you.   and he ll be angry. 
Not  that s not Jon. All alone with the wicked Lannisters. 
Do you know how happy Cersei would wants  what she always wanted. 
You are scared the Northern Are you going to say  But 
I was just a child   you just hate wildlings  
I could not give two shits about wildlings. when you were a baby  
I didn t trip  I was pushed. I don t think you re truly mean. 
You have sad eyes.   Cock. 
Ah  dick. Nop  it s pussy for me. 
I have a beauty waiting for Brienne of Tarth  
  You know her  You do know her. 
We ve met. Great big monsters. 
They conquer the world. I m good at killing people. 
  You don t look much like him. I suppose you favor your mother. 
You knew him  He sent me off hunting for the Mountain. 
Your wildlings then told me the Red Woman six times. 
We both serve the same lord. The Lord of Light never spoke to me. 
I don t know anything about him. I   Why  
  I don t know. So what s the point of serving a god  
none of us knows what he wants  Except one thing. 
We re soldiers. know can sit in a throne made of swords. 
So what are you fighting for  The first enemy. 
And the last. But we can keep up the life. 
We can defend those who guards the realm of men. 
Maybe we don t need to Aye. 
Maybe that s enough. of King s Landing. 
I don t want you to be a hero. even this... 
Jon Snow. It s interesting  these heroes you name... 
Drogo  Jorah  I know you re brave. 
I wouldn t have chosen a coward as my Hand. get to meet your sister. 
From everything you ve told me about her But if we go to the capital  
we ll go with two armies  King s Landing burns down 
to the foundation stone. Laying any traps  
If we want to create a are the best ways to start. 
Which war was won without deceit and mass murder  You need to inspire a degree of fear. 
But fear is all Cersei has. It makes their power brittle. 
Because everyone beneath a long way on fear. 
He did. Aegon built the wheel. 
If that s the kind of queen you want to be  So we walk into the lion s den  
My brother promised me he d keep about any Lannister promises. 
Except yours. Impulsive  
This will be a difficult negotiation. My sister is likely to say 
something provocative. That was not impulsive. 
That was necessary. Perhaps the father needed 
to die and not the son. We had no time to discuss the possibility 
before you ended their possibilities. I am taking their side. 
You need to take your enemy s side. if you re gonna anticipate their actions  
respond effectively and beat them. and the world you want to build. 
But the world you want to build How do we ensure your vision endures  
After you break the wheel  how But any one of them could have 
found your heart and end... Is this one of the items you ve discussed 
with your brother in King s Landing  Perhaps if you d planned 
for the short term  after I wear the crown. 
Prepare. We have to get him back to Eastwatch. 
Flask. I just got bit by a dead bear. 
Aye. Alright then. 
  Where did she get it  You re worried. 
We re asking   men to fight with us The weather will be the 
least of their problem. You question their loyalty  
Their loyalty is to Jon. Ably. 
They see that  they respect you. when it was time to retake Winterfell 
and then they named him their king and now Bloody Windbanes. 
If they found out I wrote that letter... By the time Jon comes back  
he ll have no army left. You may have disagreements  
but she would never betray her family. Is that what she thinks  
I don t know what she thinks. She s sworn to protect both 
of Catelyn Stark girls. And if one of you were planning 
to harm the other in any way  Something I ve always wanted to know. 
Alright. For being honest  I don t remember 
charging through the breach. Some damn good scrap. 
Alright. some kind of god. 
The way you were waving that flaming sword. Just the drunkest. 
Where s the rest of them  Go back to Eastwatch. 
Get a raven to Daenerys    You re the fastest. 
Go  Now  Give it  
Stop  show us the way.

Unless the Lord of Light is kind For the night is dark and full of terrors. 
We ll all freeze soon. almost all the dead that followed it fell. 
Why    Maybe we ll stand a chance. 
  No. Daenerys is our only chance. 
No. He turned them all. 
You don t understand.  No one else  just us. 
Did he do it to watch us freeze to death  I ve been waiting for the end for a long time. 
Maybe the Lord brought me here to find it. should be any different. 
Milady. To King s Landing. 
  Milady  you are the Lady of Winterfell. at this gathering as you see them. 
They invited you  they want you there. They want another Stark prisoner  
they can come and take me. It s not safe. 
Ser Jaime will be there. It s not safe leaving 
you with Littlefinger. whether or not you re here. 
And you trust their loyalty  Let me at least leave Podrick 
behind to watch over you. The trip to King s Landing 
is long  Lady Brienne  The sooner you leave  the better 
your chances of making it on time. The most important person in the world can t 
fly to the most dangerous place in the world. They knew the risk when they left. 
You can t win the throne if you re dead. we re all lost. 
Everyone  everything... Fall back  
Come on  Go  
Go now  Leave  Fucking hope not. 
It s time to go  Your Grace. I have hundreds of men here at 
Winterfell  all loyal to me.   My faces. 
  Where did you get them  What does that mean  
Back in Braavos  before The game of faces. 
It s simple  I ask you a I don t want to play. 
How do you feel about Jon being king  Those faces  what are they  
Is that what you should be asking  You wanted to be a queen. 
To sit next to a handsome young king To pick up a sword like 
father and go off to battle. The world doesn t just let girls

Speak in their voice  live in their skin. to wear those pretty dresses.

    A lot of them will die climbing      i which is more than you   ve ever done for me.  i 
    My people have bled enough.    Just like you. We need your tunnel.
    Now we both know that winter is coming.    we   ll all end up worse than dead.
    You want to strike a bargain with me     and I swear to you that no one else will die.

    I was sent to discuss terms    You will address him as Your Grace.
    I know he   s the king. My father died for him.    He could have tortured me. He could have killed me.

    Your Grace.    All of them.

    Usually Mantari in origin.    Yes  there is.
    May I ask what you think you   re doing     but Ser Gregor is beyond saving.
    Well  well beyond.    That   s for the best.
    No maester knows how to save him.    His curiosity was deemed dangerous and unnatural.
    Rightly so  in my opinion.    Not anymore.

    the process may change him       as soon as Tommen marries Margaery.
    I will not.    You have on several occasions made great claims
    about your commitment to this family   s future.    I don   t care.
    I will stay in King   s Landing whereI was called to the capital.
    I decided to take yournot be left at Casterly Rock
    under any circumstances. And if you recall       about the time you won.
    This isn   t going to be one of those times.    When you marched into the throne room to tell me
    we   d won the Battle of Blackwater    Do you remember     That   s how far I was willing to go when I thought
    someone awful had come to take my son away.    Joffrey is dead.
    Myrcella   s been sold like livestock.    My last boy.
    Margaery will dig her claws in     like beasts until you rip him apart.
    I will burn our house to the    I   ll tell everyone the truth.
     i What truth would that be   i     How is that possible 
    What am I saying  Of course it   s possible.    We were right there in front
of you and you didn   t see us.    No.
    Your legacy is a lie.    Yes  you do.
    Jaime.    There   s really nothing you wouldn   t do  is there 
    For my family  no  nothing.    Tyrion is your family.
    He   s not.    You can choose the creature that killed
our mother to come into this world       A disease doesn   t decide to kill you.
    All the same  you cut it out before it does.    to endure all that  only to find you   
    I choose you.    Like the ones I just said to Father.
    I told him.    You told him 
    I told him I won   t marry Loras Tyrell.    You think he   ll just accept that 
    Go and ask him.    I don   t choose Tywin Lannister.
    I don   t love Tywin Lannister.    People will whisper  they   ll make their jokes.
    Let them.    Someone will walk in.
    I don   t care.    Before you freed me  I belonged to Master Mighdal.
    I was tutor to his children.    When you took the city  the children begged me
    not to leave the house.     i I went to one of these places.  i 
    The young prey on the old.     i With my master  I was a teacher.  i 
    I had the respect and love of his children.    I am not alone.
    There are many outside waiting to beg the same of you.    I took it to bring people freedom.
    But freedom means making your own choices.    It may not cover a period
lasting longer than a year.    The masters will take advantage of this situation.

And when she grew bored of that  the people  and I will. 
But I need your help  my lords. She has three full grown

The nobles loved her. Commoners  nobles  
they re all just children  really. I m grateful to you  Lady 
Olenna  for your counsel. I will not attack King s Landing. 
We will not attack King s Landing. but no food for her army or the people. 
But we won t use Dothraki and Unsullied. by appealing to their loyalty  
their love for their country. Our army should be Westerosi. 
And I suppose we re Lady Greyjoy will escort 
you home to Sunspear. back up to King s Landing. 
The Dornish will lay Two great kingdoms

Lord Varys. We are all praying for prince 
Joffrey s full recovery. I told them this meeting

Indeed you are  my lady. permission to defend the North. 
We ll begin training every man  While we re preparing for attack  
we need to shore up our defenses. and the Wall hasn t been 
properly manned in centuries. this winter together... 
You want us to man the castles for you  Night King was at Hardhome. 
The closest castle to Hardhome Looks like we re the Night s Watch now. 
If they breach the Wall  The castles committed no crimes. 
And we need every fortress and Karhold to new families  
loyal families who generation after generation. 
And then they broke faith. because of the crimes 
of a few reckless sons. The punishment for treason is death. 
Smalljon Umber died on the field of battle. 
They died fighting for Ramsay. When I was Lord Commander 
of the Night s Watch... refused to follow orders. 
My father always said  Ned Umber. 
Alys Karstark. I ask you to pledge your loyalty 
once again to House Stark  whenever called upon. 
Stand. all the living north. 
Will you stand beside me  Ned and Alys  and ladies  you undermine me. 
So I can t question Joffrey never let anyone 
question his authority. What did father used to say  
Everything before the No. No  he never cursed 
in front of his girls. how dirty the world really is  
but Father couldn t protect You have to be smarter than Father. 
You need to be smarter than Robb. and they both lost their heads for it. 
And how should I be smarter  A raven from King s Landing  Your Grace. 
 Cersei of House Lannister  Protector of the Seven Kingdoms...  
What does she want  the fate of all traitors. 
You ve been so consumed the one to the south. 
I m consumed with the Night There s a thousand miles 
between us and Cersei. They ve never ranged this far north. 
You re the military man  but I know her. Everyone who s ever crossed 
her  she s found a way to murder. for  whether he knew it or not. 
He knew it. It s ours now. We just have to take it. 
You ve been quiet since you came home. Are you afraid of me  
Should I be  Right now  they re sailing 
across the Narrow Sea  the one you love so much  
the one you set free  Where will they land  
Dragonstone. Stannis left the castle unoccupied  
and that s where she was born. Ellaria Sand and her brood of bitches. 
Enemies to the west... Enemies to the north. 
Ned Stark s bastard has Sansa stands beside him. 
Enemies everywhere. We re the Lannister army now. 
  How do we proceed  feed our men and our horses. 
The Tyrells have the grain  No one wants to fight 
on the losing side. Three kingdoms  at best. 
I m not sure you understand in a war for survival. 
I understand whoever loses dies. that lasts a thousand years. 
A dynasty for whom  A dynasty for us  then. 
We never talked about Tommen. He betrayed me. 
He betrayed us both. Mother  father  and all our children  
  Cersei... we re still flesh and blood. 
We re the last Lannisters  survive without allies. 
Where are our allies now  I heard. 
  How could we ever trust a man like that  but the Freys supported us. 
Now they re all dead. We need allies. 
Stronger  better allies. for  years and learned nothing  
The Greyjoys    Not all of them. 
  Well  it looks like all of them. You said yourself we needed 
stronger  better allies. How are they different from the Freys  
They both broke their promises So does everyone when it suits them. 
Unlike the Freys  they have ships. I know the ironborn. They re 
bitter  angry little people. Euron Greyjoy didn t come here for that. 
Oh  what did he come here for  then  Lord of the Iron Islands  
they turned on me. Sailed them right across the world 
and gave them to the Dragon Queen It s nothing compared to 
the treason you suffered But still  it bothers me. 
Murdering them would our treasonous family members 
are fighting for the same side  You re not a rightful 
monarch  though  are you  but as I recall  you 
were soundly defeated. started that rebellion 
by sailing to Casterly Rock Very smart move on your part. 
Of course  we all made it I remember very well. 
I saw you. No one can stop him. 
I didn t believe it  to be honest. and started cutting people down... 
it was glorious. down were your own kin. 
The place was getting crowded. A good thing for me. 
If you hadn t crushed us  I I wouldn t be the greatest 
captain on the  seas. You re the queen of a great nation. 
You don t care about the Iron Islands. And a lot of very unattractive people. 
The Iron Fleet  on the other hand  Westeros has ever seen. 
With the Iron Fleet  you own the seas. the north and south. 
What do you want in return  the most beautiful woman in the world. 
So here I am  I decline your proposal. 
Why  and murdered them at 
the nearest opportunity. I don t expect you to trust me outright. 
You need proof of my honest intentions. heart is with a gift. 
A priceless gift. Ah  Maester Weyland. 
A drinker s liver if ever I saw one. Mankind s curse. 
Archmaester  I was wondering... I was wondering if you had

Everyone in the Citadel But the tales of the Long 
Night can t be pure fabrication. Sources in the restricted area  
The very same. with the white walkers 
is that you re telling the truth I do. 
You ll finish weighing that heart  We re not like the 
people south of the Twins. In the Citadel  we lead different 
lives for different reasons. Without us  men would be 
little better than dogs. And every time you leave

The Wall has stood through it all. I ve heard she beat the

You re right about that. I ve met better men than you

None of them came back. Every hour of every day  
Why am I here  And  
I don t know. I want to show you something. 
It s my fucking luck I end up and that girl would be alive.

You deserved better. Mom.

Hello  my old friend. the revenge you want

And getting attacked I was starting 
to wonder what to do When the Lord Commander 
says we go  we go.   How d that turn out for us  
  He had no way of knowing. Craster s been out here

His life fit him ever be a brother to me  
He s the King in the North. and I made it. 
I could never be a Stark. I paid the iron price

Why    It was the only way. 
  You burned a little girl alive  children  your Lord is evil. 
We are standing here because of him. I loved that girl

 i Aye  you were wrong.  i  this woman for murder. 
 i She admits to the crime.  i  I ve been ready

Do shut up  dear. Let the grown women speak. 
The Lannisters have declared We must be allies now 
if we wish to survive.  i She killed my grandson.  i

It is not survival I offer. I saw them painting the sails. 
I m curious to see how the New strategy

Good. The only people who 
aren t afraid of failure Just impatient to get on with it. 
He wasn t the first to love you failed to console me. 
For what it s worth  Everyone s always asking me 
to believe in things   until I saw where belief got people. 
So I said no  thank you to belief. It s embarrassing  really. 
I d swear you my sword  It s yours. 
Now and always. I had something made for you. 
I m not sure if it s right. Well  what are they doing

I came here every day Back then I only thought 
about what I wanted  You were a child. 
What do you want  No  you weren t. 
Every time I m faced with a decision  Whenever I consider 
an action  I ask myself Pull it out of my mind 
and into the world  It s never stopped you

or you can prepare for the future. Who should the North rally behind  
A trueborn daughter or a motherless bastard
