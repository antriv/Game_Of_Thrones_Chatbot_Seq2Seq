Poor Ned Stark. Brave man  Go on  say something clever. 
Catelyn Stark took my brother. Ned Stark. 
One of our men interfered... Why is he still alive  
It wouldn t have been clean. worrying about what other people think of you. 
I could care less what to think of you. 
It s the truth. Of course it bothers me. 
A lion doesn t concern himself that your varity  
got in a way of your reckelessnes. I didn t realize you place such 
a high value on my brother s life. but he s one of us. 
And everyday that he remain a prisoner   No  that s not an opinion  it s a fact. 
If another house can seize we are no longer house to be feared. 
Your mother is dead. and your brother... 
and your sister and all of her children... Is the family name 
that lives on. not your honor... but family. 
You understand  You re blessed you belong to 
the most powerful family in the kingdom. One a mad man  the other are drunk. 
The future of our family will be that would last a thousand years... 
or we could collapse into nothing. you re always meant to be. 
Not next year  not tomorrow... I ve had worse  my lady. 
Perhaps it s time to go hoome. Do you  lord Stark  
Is that why you called me here  Jaime would ve killed him. 
My brother s worth or your lover  
Targaryens wed brothers and sisters we belong together. 
My son saw you with him.   No more than I love mine. 
  And they re all Jaime s. for long enough to stumble drunk into my bed  
I finished him off another ways And when I finally saw him on our wedding day 
in the Sept of Baelor. And that night he crawl on top of me  
stinking of wine Your sister was a corpse 
and I was a living girl I ll tell him the truth. 
You must be gone by then... Go as far away as you can.. 
With as many men as you can. yourself. Such a sad mistake. 
I ve made many mistakes in my life.. When you play the game of thrones  
you win or you die. is that what they teach you 
up in the North  how ridiculous you sound  
Either of you understand the thing that I m saying  You be the man  and you be the woman. 
Go ahead. they just paid you  they know what you are. 
They know its all just an act And that takes time. 
You need to.. Ease into it. 
He s winding you over  He wants to believe you. 
He s enjoyed his cock since he was old enough He s always known it deep down inside 
now he has proof. What she doesn t know 
will not hurt her  And she loved me too. 
I was her little confidant. She told me about 
all the horses that she liked. A northener.. 
with a jaw like an anvil.  He s just a boy   she said. 
 Please don t hurt him .   And she still married to him  
  Oh  no. an even more impressive spciment. 
She love him  I m afraid. he just so... 
good. I learned that I ll never win. 
Not that way. can we get what we want. 
And what do you want  Now wash yourself  
both of you are working tonight. Where I come from we don t show mercy 
to criminals. the low tide will lay you on your back  
on the beach.. You ll see death creeping toward you  
a few inches at a time. They far away  
You ve never heard of the Iron Islands  And what s that  
Lord. What do you mean  why   
My father is Balon Greyjoy  Your father s lord  
how can you be lord too  No  you... 
You having a go at me  how you southerner do things. 
I m not a southerner. You re an impudent little wench  
aren t you  Impudent. It means rude. 
Disrespectful. The lady is our guest. 
Thought she was our prisoner. that can chew that boy up. 
And pick their teeth with his bones. Meant to get much further south 
than this. As far as south as south goes. What do you afraid of  
Those thing that sleep in the day   I m not talking about owl and shadowcats. 
The thing you speak of.. They were sleeping. 
And they re sleeping no more. I never talk to them. 
Just lookin  at them. Riders  
The horn. We have to blow the horn. Two for wildlings 
  Three.. where s my uncle  
Ned  I should have spent more time with you. 
Shown to you how to be a man. you don t want to see this. 
My fault.. Stinks. 
Stinks like death. I drove my knife 
right through his brain the kingdom ever saw.. 
And I want everyone I need to talk to Ned. 
  Robert  my sweet... Paper and ink. On the table. 
Write down what I said. First of... you know how it goes. 
Put in the damn titles.. titles..titles... 
to serve as Lord Regent and Protector of The Realm  upon my death.. You ll rule now. 
You ll hate it worse than I did.. Daenerys... 
you re right.   I will. 
My son... I ll... 
I ll do everything I can King Robert Baratheon... 
murdered by a pig. Give him milk of the poppy. 
He was reeling from the wine.. I failed him. 
No men could ve protected him from himself. His Grace did not lack refreshment. 
I do hope the poor lad concerning Daenerys Targaryen. 
Whatever arrangements you made... The Khaleesi likely dead already. 
Can you help me make him.. understand  Have patience  Khaleesi. We will 
go home  I promise you. the rightful heir to the Seven Kingdoms. 
Have I said something funny  ser  didn t seize six of the kingdoms 
because it his right. And because he had dragons. 
Having few dragons makes things easier. I believe what my eyes and ears report. 
As for the rest  it was  years ago  I ll seek out the merchant captain.. 
  see if he has any letter for me. Enjoy the market. 
I ll rejoin you soon enough. and his congratulations. 
Overall pardon  try your summer wine. Just a taste. 
My lady  you are from Westeros  Khaleesi of the riding men  
and princess of the Seven Kingdoms. I still like to taste that wine. 
That  Nectar of the Gods. 
Let me give you a cask. The honor.. the honor is all mine. 
You know there are many in your homeland The wine is for the Khaleesi  
it s not for the likes of you. It would be a crime to drink a wine this rich 
without at least giving it time to breathe. Sweet  isn t it  
Can you smell the fruit  ser  that has ever touch your tongue. 
You first. Beside  is it a poor wine merchant 
who drink up his own wares You came to us as outlaws.. 
poachers.. or you came to us poor. 
Some of you bear the name or no names at all. 
It does not matter. on the Wall. 
we re all one house. you re going to be a ranger. 
It s not what you always wanted  I know he is. 
I wish I could help you  You re honored being a steward. 
Not much  really. or the honor of this house or that house. 
Not for gold  glory .. and all the people in it. 
You all learned the words  your vow is death. 
You can take your vows here.. Do any of you still keep the Old Gods  
I do  my lord. Yes  my lord. 
You ll find the weirwoods  My Lord  
Might I go as well  I was name in the light of the Seven.. 
as my father was the Gods of your father and your house  
The Night s Watch is my house now. As you wish. 
You all been  Grenn  to the rangers. 
Samwell  to the stewards. Ballion  to the rangers 
Rast  to the rangers Ihyll  to the builders. 
Gordor  to the stewards. Samwell... 
you will assisst me in the rookery  you will report to Bowen Marsh   
in the kitchen. present yourself to Borcas when you arrive.. 
Make no comment about his nose. And keep the fire burning in his chambers.. 
change his sheets  You take me for a servant  
We took you for a man of the Night s Watch. As you wish. 
Jon  Wait  he wanted it and he got it. 
Steward are nothing It s not fair  
Fair  when he put his hand in my leg  
and he wanted to see my cock. for stealing when he s over. 
So now I m here  but old men and little shit like you. 
I ll never see my family again. I thought you were caught stealing  
a wheel of cheese.. the old man  is the Lord Commander  
of The Night s Watch. I always wanted to be a ranger. 
I always wanted to be a wizard. So you ll stay and say your word with me  
Lord Stark. He name you Protector of The Realm. 
He did. a hundred of swords at your command. 
  And what should I do with a hundred swords   protecting the realm . 
Stannis is your older brother. against the Mad King.. 
it shouldn t matter now. We all know what Stannis is.. 
He inspires no love  or loyalty. Stannis is a commander. 
He s led men into war  twice. so is Robert. 
Tell me something. Do you still believe by shedding blood in his house.. 
and dragging frightened children  You will place this in the hand of Stannis Baratheon. 
Not his steward. Only Stannis himself. 
Yes  my lord. The king has no trueborn son. 
Joffrey and Tommen  are Jaime Lannister s bastards. Lord Stannis. 
So it would seem. He is the rightful heir. 
Nothing can change that. You would be wise to denied to him. 
And to make sure Joffrey succeeds. and Protector of The Realm  
all the power is yours  you need only.. Release The Imp. 
Wed your daughter to Joffrey. and if Joffrey seems likely to cause problems  
when he come into his throne..   We  
You ll need someone to share this burdens  Would you suggest this treason  
Only if we lose.   So it will be Stannis  and war  
  There is no other choice. Not for my wisdom clearly. 
You promised Catelyn and hundred man at arms. 
Enough to overwhelm what remain  The City Watch is two thousand strong. 
and sworn to defend the king s peace. You know it has to be done. 
But it s not honorable  so... and the Hand proclaim another.. 
who s peace to the Gold Cloaks protect  Hear my words   
and bear witness to my vow  I am the watcher on the walls. 
I am the shield that guards the realm of men. You knelt as boys.. 
rise now as men  What he s got there  
To me  Ghost. What will they do to him  
When the khalasar rides.. he won t be the last. 
I thought he d leave me alone  He will never abandon the hunt. 
You are Targaryen. with . riders behind him. 
He will not have my son. King Joffrey and the queen regent 
request you presence in the throne room. The Gods give him rest. 
All is accomplished. an hour before dawn.. 
with ser Loras Tyrell We stand behind you  lord Stark. 
All hail His Grace   The King of The Andal  and The First Men.. 
Lord of The Seven Kingdoms I believe no men here  
could ever question your honor. Lord Eddard Stark is herein named.. 
Protector of The Realm.. May I see that letter  ser Barristan  
Protector of The Realm. A piece of paper. 
Those were the king s words. you offer me some counsel. 
Allow me to return the courtesy. and swear loyalty to my son. 
And we shall allow you to live out the days Your son has no claim to the throne. 
Liar  Kill him  Kill all of them.

Mon fr re  Lord Stark ... She... 
She had red hair.   What do you want me to say  
I want you to tell me To love someone and have them  
love you back. You re the closest 
I ll ever get to knowing. She just had a baby. 
And she never offered. You d have broken your vows  
The interesting thing is  intimate relations with women. 
What   I shall father no children.  
It s very specific. activities is open 
to interpretation. Anyway  there s nothing 
for him to interpret. It s... 
there s this person  and they re wrapped up in you. 
And you... you re more than just you. 
You re... I don t know. What did I get for it  
An arrow six inches of us soon  I imagine. 
There will. Go get some sleep  Sam. 
I ll take this watch.   Yes. 
That was a night to remember. Her fangs were sharp  
but she knew how to use them. No  she was no ordinary beast. 
Many is the man who... fucked a bear. 
Right now I don t want to think to think about 
is each one of these arrows finding here a while. 
Good. But they came up here to our land 
and put up a big wall hunting us down. 
This time  we re the ones to say about killing. 
Even more words than arrows. More  I reckon. 
Yes  but none of those So you ve said. 
And if not  More words. 
Know what I think Maybe I have. 
Jon Snow is mine. And not one of your bald friends 
is fast enough to stop me. Maester Aemon. 
  How did you know... would be wasting candles 
to read in the middle   Oh  no need. 
I know my way place in Castle Black. 
Thousands of books source of ironies... 
...if nothing else. What are you reading  
Maester Faull. the closest Maester Faull 
ever got to a wildling about what they do  
it s all true. Yes  imagine the stories 
wildlings tell about us. Jon Snow once. 
He didn t listen to the girl you love. 
I don t... love her. Yes  you do. 
Heard it in your voice  I was in love once. 
You were  befalling that poor 
girl and her child. more or less  like you  
I m sorry  Maester. before I came here  
What I could have been here I met many girls 
when I was Aemon Targaryen. in their attempts 
to win my affections. Who was she  
Ah. Who she was  
how we met  I can see her... 
right in front of me. trading tales of lost loves. 
Nothing makes the past  i  You don t understand. 
They killed everyone.  i   i I saw them on my way here.  i  
 i They may have seen me.    I can t. 
  Sam  is that you  orders to not open the gate. 
Oh  Pyp  open the fucking gate  Are you all right  
Shh  you re all right.   It was horrible. 
  I m so  so sorry. send me away  Sam. 
  Never. will be having words with me.

Beyond the trees  Light them all  
Move  That s the last 
of the oil  Ser Alliser. clever little twats  
for everyone. Not if you lot do your duty 
for however long it takes to go on hating me 
and I get to go on wishing  i You ll be safe down here.  i  
I ll check on you I m not leaving you. 
You re going up there and we re we d stay together. 
I... I didn t mean in the same room. They ll kill you. In Mole s Town   
they killed everyone. Why not  You won t 
matter up there. because that s what men do. 
Promise me you won t die. with a proper edge. 
This is no place for me to be. There s a band of wildlings 
coming to kill us. But I had to do something. 
I didn t have any choice. If someone had asked 
me my name right then  I wasn t a steward 
in the Night s Watch I was nothing at all. 
And when you re nothing at all  But you re afraid now  
Yes  well... Didn t count more than  down here.

hurry than you were.  i Come on with the rocks   i  
Nock  Down  
No  No  It s gonna open.

Well  then... I ll get help. 
Shh. Shh. Shh. Shh.

Let s go  Cut the rope  
Wait  No  are over the walls. 
Ser Alliser s fallen. Edd  you have the Wall. 
If they try the mammoths again   drop the scythe on them. 
Come  brothers. How are we gonna stop that  
Shot  arrows in him already. Jon Snow s not Lord Commander. 
We hold the gate  The gods aren t down here. 
It s the six of us. hold no lands

I am the sword I am the shield that guards 
the realms of men. for this night 
and all the nights to come  There won t be anywhere 
to hide if the castle falls. Ha  
Jon Snow. Do you remember the cave  
We should have You know nothing  Jon Snow. 
Drop the scythe  boys  They ve had enough

Tormund. This is how a man ends. 
Put him in chains. from the top of the Wall  boy  
Aye. It s me. 
I promised you  didn t I  And he has more giants. 
He has more mammoths. Maybe we can hold them 
off for a day or two  Going to find Mance. 
To fi... Who s left to give orders  
The wildling army s only Without Mance  
they lose their leader. Scatter back to their homes. 
Without Mance  They ll never let you 
within  yards of him. They won t just kill you. 
They ll boil you. You re right. 
It s a bad plan. Get some brothers 
down here to help you. Then lower it again 
as soon as I m out. Tell them all to stop. 
For how long  You re learning 
to talk like a Queen. Lord Snow here 
grew up in a castle Everybody knew

Your Grace.   Your Grace. 
I grieve for him as well   he grew to be. 
I need to speak to you about to you there d be no need to

And I ve never known you me on truth  
I ve come to tell you have come to my side. 
Except the Tyrells  to resist us now. 
Soon I shall be sitting what this will cost you  
  not even the Iron   consolidated my troops. 
We ll make short work is cleared  
we ll deliver our troops to their Lady Melisandre with you  
That s not your concern. I never thought I d have reason to

Buy my fruit  My Lord. more ships  more horses. 
What do we have  Well  I ve never actually been 
able to kill people with it. Being repeatedly humiliated by 
Robb Stark is time consuming. not the way Joffrey s 
planning on holding it. bloated  foul.

You re the crew Welcome. 
Stop. you to stop. 
Where are we to raid their villages. 
 i There ll be spoils  i  And who decides if we ve 
done our jobs well  Don t reckon I ve got much use 
for your ideas on how to do it. head out on your own. 
And I will hunt you down  to come see me off. 
Oh  I m not here to Red Harbor. 
I ve got  ships. There s   You d better get out there. 
Wouldn t want them My crew would wait on deck 
for a year if I asked them to. Come on  
I ll take you out. That would be good 
for a laugh. And how am I supposed 
to prove myself by pillaging And yet that s the task 
my father has given me  i They re all Iron Islanders.  i  
Do they do as they re told from Torrhen s Square. 
The seat of the House a few fishermen s daughters. 
What  you don t think We could never hold it 
for more than a few days. The Starks have 
overextended their lines. keeping their men 
and horses fed. The cold won t beat them. 
Our spies report growing and gather the harvest 
before the crops turn. they would report growing discontent 
amongst the southern lords. We ve underestimated 
the Stark boy for too long. And as long as he keeps 
winning battles  You ve been waiting 
for him to fail. So how do we stop him  
 i We ve worked through  i  from some sleep. 
As I think you re my cousin  
I might even let you must miss you. 
My wife s in Lannisport. Go before I change my mind 
and send her your head. you d be scrubbing out pots 
in the cook s tent. Go  for some time. 
Girl. And who are the Lords 
of Maidenpool  And what is their Sigil  
A red salmon. You re a northerner  
aren t you  And  
They say he rides into battle on a wolf himself when he wants. 
They say he can t be killed. Anyone can be killed. 
Fetch that water. her mouth closed. 
 i No one hears   i  A boy becomes a girl. 
I was always a girl. and wrong for me  
I didn t have a choice. And here we are. 
A man pays his debts. The Red God takes 
what is his  lovely girl. You saved me 
and the two I was with. We have to give them back. 
Speak three names Three lives 
I will give you   tortures everyone. 
A man needs a name. the Tickler. 
That is enough. The Halfhand does things 
in his own time. Most of them are true. 
I heard the Halfhand spent half to survive out here on their own. 
Well  possible Gilly would love it here. 
There s nothing more sickening  i At least you ll keep warm.  i

And I don t think One blast is for rangers returning. 
Wildlings is two blasts.  i wondering.  i  
 i One blast for friends   i  for White Walkers.

It s Qhorin Halfhand. Hurrah. 
Take care  My Lord.  piss on wildfire 
and your cock burns off.  It could well be true. 
The substance stone  even steel  
and  of course  flesh. After the dragons died  
wildfire was the key If I could tell you 
how many crazy old men making grand claims about 
jars full of pig shit... The substance 
is fire given form. To do what  
The jars are put in catapults If you could get real soldiers 
to man the catapults  but all the real soldiers are in 
the Riverlands with your father. I don t know if you ve 
ever seen a battle  old man   Cause when we re flinging 
things at Stannis  Men die  men shit 
themselves  men run  which means fire 
inside the walls  end up burning it down. 
My friend remains insult my order 
whilst Aerys Targaryen living anymore. 
And all his pots of wildfire not magic tricks. 
We have been working commanded us to do so. 
Our present count stands Baratheon s fleet 
and armies both. with my advisor  wisdom Hallyne.

She s not a princess. Khaleesi. 
You are their guest. the night market. 
The Qartheen night market is like The Meereens think 
they have a night market. Please excuse me 
for a moment.  i the rest is pure gold.  i  
Very soft. He can chop off thing the Dothraki knew how to do 
was steal things They re quite good 
at killing the better men. A demonstration  
Take this gem. So many facets. 
Look closely enough and you Should you grow tired of 
Xaro s baubles and trinkets  You re always welcome  
Mother of Dragons. of the Thirteen. 
It was customary for me slow deaths in Qarth. 
What is the House to squint at dusty books 
and drink shade and their minds soft   
so soft  are magic. 
 i You watch over her.  i  Jorah Mormont 
of Bear Island. But she is 
the Mother of Dragons. They shall come 
day and night And fire is power. 
It looked like Stannis. A shadow in 
the shape of a man. We should reach 
my son s camp tomorrow. Only long enough to tell 
Robb what I have seen. I m sorry. 
My own mother died It s a bloody business. 
What comes after I swore a vow. 
But Stannis has to keep him safe. 
 i I m as good  i  Renly s death 
was no fault of yours. that once 
as he was dying. by following him into the earth. 
Renly s enemies are your son  My Lady... 
but I could serve you Not battle courage  perhaps  
but  I don t know   i when the time comes   i  
 i you will not hold me back.  i  from Stannis. 
When the time comes  My Lady. 
I will shield your back I swear it by the Old Gods 
and the new. and at my table 
and that I shall ask bring you dishonor. 
I swear it by the Old Gods  i just thieves  My Lord.  i  
 i There s wolves  i  They ll fight  
keep fighting I have no one to man 
my flock now. Only me. We can send two orphan boys 
from Winterstown home with you if you can give them 
room and board. Stop it. 
If that s everyone  I m going   Hodor. 
  Hodor. is under siege. 
Torrhen s Square is barely paid by Tywin Lannister. 
We have to help them. but I can gather 
 decent men. our own bannermen  
why should Take the men you need. 
Won t take long  My Lord. I did ask him. He d never 
heard of a three eyed raven. You might be a little lord  
but don t you call me a liar. Well  it s not far off. 
So  you ve been dreaming you told me you didn t dream. 
Now who s a liar  Something bad  
Tell me  boy. I saw waves crashing 
against the gates  i flooded the castle.  i  
Drowned men what do they say about it 
north of the wall    There. 
 i   Where   i  A fire. 
There s a fire. When they see us coming  
that fire becomes a signal. How many wildlings 
have joined him   i Mance has gathered them all  i  
 i like deer against the wolves.  i  Where  
Somewhere safe.  i into their midst.  i  
And we can t wait for them You saying we should 
fall back to the Wall  He s gonna teach them 
our way of doing things. when we hit back. 
 i They re gonna be more  i  more like us. 
So we need to be on the Wall. 
And to do that... It s not a job 
for  men. Harker  Stonesnake  
Borba. I ve been called 
lots of things  How many rangers 
can say that  You killed a Wight. 
You also let an old man  i Craster   i

It would be no trouble. than you do a steward. 
Go on. been in love with you  
He s not my manservant my friend. 
Unlikely. And what about 
what a woman wants  Because I promised 
my Khalasar I d protect them the Seven Kingdoms  
I want them because and I will take it. 
Ah  a conqueror.   Did someone give it to you  
  No. you had and you took it. 
You re a conqueror  too. What do you want  
Xaro Zhoan Daxos  Why  
I will show you why. The hardest steel 
does not make a mark. their weight in gold 
if they could break into it. They all went home 
empty handed. is this key. 
And behind the door  Let us say half. 
More than enough to buy All I have to do  
Is marry me. My mother and father 
never owned a pair of shoes. than you thought. 
The time is right  Robert Baratheon 
is dead. The Seven Kingdoms are 
at war with one another. To win Westeros  you need 
support from Westeros. the Lannisters  
and Baratheons your new friend 
who earned your trust to find ships and an army 
or we ll spend the rest Rich men do not become rich 
by giving more than they get. Moving carefully is the hard way  
but it s the right way. outside the gates of Qarth  
we d all be dead by now. but you must   
Do not speak to me   What do you want  
Tell me.   Why  
  You have a good claim. But you have something 
more than that. and should rule. 
Centuries come and go There are times 
when I look at you So what would you 
have me do as my advisor  You only need one. 
The allies we need the ship  
 i I ll find it for you.  i  I look forward 
to meeting him. sideface. 
Sideface    Smaller target. 
Am I fighting someone  You should practice right. 
Guards  Go up there. Go and see where 
he fell from. Move away. 
 i Stand back.  i        Carpe Diem       
Easy  easy. They stabbed me. 
Olly... The lady brought you back. 
Afterwards  after they stabbed you  Nothing. 
There was nothing at all. And now you re not. 
That s completely fucking I don t know. 
Maybe we ll never know. You fight for as long as you can. 
You clean up as much of They think you re some kind of god. 
The man who returned from the dead. I saw your pecker. 
What kind of god would Is that still you in there  
I think so. You sure that s still you in there  
You all right  think the sea was called the see 
because it was nothing but water It was before I learned 
how to read  obviously. be in the south soon. 
I m excited to see Oldtown. you there or for Little Sam. 
I stayed at Castle Black. I don t have a Jon Snow or Maester 
Aemon to help me bend the rules. With a baby and no money  
So if we re not going to Oldtown  Horn Hill. 
My father s... well  my father  They ll take care of you both. 
 Wherever you go  I go  too.  and Little Sam to be safe. 
That s all I want... so you ll be safe. 
Us and everyone else in the world. I care about you and him. 
I know that  Sam. If you think it s for the best

Now it ends. But Father beat him. 
Did he  He stabbed him in the back. 
What s in the tower    I want to see where he s going. 
  Time to go. Take me back there. I want to go back. 
No.   Maybe he heard the wind. 
  He heard me. What s in that tower  
I want to go back there. you will never return. 
Why do I want to return  You think I wanted to sit 
here for   years So why did you  
I was waiting for you. You won t be here forever. 
You won t be an old man in a tree. Learn what  
Everything. If we could have the room. 
You look lovely today  my dear. without breaking a sweat. 
If you re going to torture me  Though it so often is 
what people deserve. My job is to find the right answers. 
Do you know how I do that  You ve sacrificed your body for a cause  
which is more than most people do. to destroy our city and our history. 
I understand. I have a different 
perspective  of course. just as I will try to 
see them from yours. That is how you pronounce it... Dom  
I m afraid I don t really Those big  brown eyes. Good 
luck keeping the ladies away. You won t torture me  you ll 
just threaten my son. Your boy is in no immediate danger  
this I swear to you. the queen s soldiers. 
We both know the penalty for that crime. And with his breathing problem. 
If I tell you anything  they ll kill me. this is a problem. 
There is a third option  though. a woman and her young son. 
I ll even throw in a bag of one of our leather clad 
friends back in to carry it. You need to decide now. 
A new life for you and Dom of them to talk about things. 
You two  you spend a great about if I weren t here

And you cannot make us stay. VISIT US   TU SUBT TITULO .C.O M. 
Your Grace. I m sorry  Your Grace. 
That s not possible. Not yet. You cut off her hair 
and marched her naked That wasn t the full atonement   
No. so we can learn the true 
extent of her sins. I am the king. 
You are. The Crown and the Faith 
are the twin pillars of the world. My mother who is unclean  
My mother who still needs to atone Above first came to us  
How did men and women Mother s love outshines it all. 
Her love for you is more real But you know that. 
You ve felt it. It s a great gift. 
One I never had. When your mother made 
her walk of atonement  why you want to put her 
through any more than It s what the gods want. 
They make their will known Please. 
If we re to be just and good  said something similar. 
Except for the part about the gods. As they work through your mother. 
There s so much good in all of us. Who are you  
No one. Tell me about Arya Stark s family. 
Her father was Eddard Stark. and four brothers.

forgetting someone  If a girl tells me her name  
I will give her eyes back. If a girl is truly no one  
she has nothing to fear. The Umbers are a famously loyal house. 
Famously loyal to the Starks. the Starks  don t they  
But here we are. Times change. your house refused to 
pledge their banners. Your father was a cunt and 
that s why you killed him. favor of dying on his own. 
My father was poisoned by our enemies. The bastard Jon Snow led an army 
of wildlings past the Wall. Wildlings come down  we always 
have to fight them first. But there are too many of them 
for us to beat back alone. The colder it gets  the farther 
south those goat fuckers will roam. can take Winterfell  
If they get Jon Snow better than we ever will. 
Pledge your banners to House Bolton. and we will fight together 
to destroy the bastard Traditionally a bannerman

Look what s left of us. hundreds of generations. 
Be like we were never there at all. The Boltons  the Karstarks  the Umbers

something  we do it. Your grandson is still a prisoner. 
You ll leave him rotting in a cell  this city because of you. 
Our two ancient houses face I delivered an army of

person I ve ever met. out through the years. 
Do you remember the It s the only truth I know. 
We must defend them. before that shoeless zealot

Come out and fight us  Blackfish. This is your last warning. 
Yield the castle. throat from ear to ear. 
And where were you  Running and Go on  then. Cut his throat. 
Lothar  is it   Cause you didn t set

Only a fool makes threats he s unless you shut your mouth  
but you kept talking. I m here by the king s command 
to take back this castle. Apologies  Ser Jaime. 
Do as he says. Get word to the Blackfish. 
I want a parley. You ve got one hand. 
My money s on the old boy. I doubt it. My mother

I was his steward. In fact... Stannis Baratheon

to him when he petitioned for men. Bear Island knows no king 
but the King in the North for House Mormont s allegiance. 
As far as I understand  you re a Snow I ve heard conflicting reports. 
I did what I had to do will always be a Stark. 
If you say so. In any case  Ramsay Bolton cannot be allowed 
to keep Winterfell  my lady. brother Rickon Stark as prisoner. 
What you have to understand  Bear Island and all who live here. 
So why should I sacrifice one more maester about my house. 
It s rather new. You never thought you d find 
yourself in your position. I never thought I d be in my position. 
I was a crabber s son  addressing the lady 
of a great house in time of war. It s our war. 
Go on  Ser Davos. He chose Jon to be his 
successor because he knew Because Jeor Mormont and 
Jon Snow both understood It s between the living and the dead. 
And make no mistake  my lady  Your uncle fought them at 
the Fist of the First Men. As long as the Boltons hold 
Winterfell  the North is divided. You want to protect your 
people  my lady. I understand. need to do it together. 
House Mormont has kept faith with Thank you  my lady. 
How many fighting men can we expect  If they re half as 
ferocious as their lady    I don t have them. 
  Pity. You know why I m here. 
This castle belongs to House Frey. Hundreds of mine. Thousands of yours. 
If you can breach the walls. But if you surrender  
I ll spare the lives of your men. Bargaining with oathbreakers 
is like building on quicksand. men to a lost cause  
As long as I m standing  I was born in this castle 
and I m ready to die in it. We have enough provisions for two years. 
Do you have two years  Kingslayer  Why did you come treat with me  
Sieges are dull. Well  now you have. 
Aye  now I have.   Lord Glover  if you could just 
hear us out.   I ve heard enough. The Boltons are traitors. 
Roose Bolton... House Mormont. 
And  You re asking me to join your army. 
Who is fighting in this army  Then the rumors are true. 
I didn t dare believe them. Now I would like you to leave. 
House Glover will not   Lord Glover. 
  There s nothing else to say. Sworn to answer when called upon. 
Yes  my family served House of your father s death. 
When my brother was lord of this And where was King Robb 
when the ironborn attacked this castle  and brutalized and killed our subjects  
Taking up with a foreign whore. I served House Stark once  
but House Stark is dead. Nothing on the Iron Islands

He ll find us. Drink. 
I don t want any. you cower like a beat dog. 
Drink the goddamn ale. If I got justice  my burnt body would

calling us animals as we dragged and my friends held her back. 
That night... I couldn t eat  I couldn t sleep. 
All I could do was stare screaming her son s name. 
I ll hear her screaming bring that lad back. 
All I can do with time I ve got left That s all any of us can do  isn t it

Where will we go  There s only one place we can go. 
Home. We ll take it back from them. 
I don t have an army. They owe you their lives. 
You think they ll be safe here if Roose   Winterfell is our home. 
It s ours and Arya s and belongs to our family. 
We have to fight for it. I ve killed brothers 
of the Night s Watch. I hanged a boy younger than Bran. 
I fought and I lost. I want you to help me. 
But I ll do it myself if I have to. Will you stay here at Castle Black

And Shireen  I saw Stannis  forces

To your father  to your Lord Royce has served the Vale well. 
He s enjoyed a distinguished he would make a capable 
commander in the wars to come. I think he deserves one more chance. 
What do you say  My friends in the North tell me 
Sansa has escaped Winterfell. as Lord Commander. 
But she won t be safe there  not We should help her. 
That was my instinct as well. The time has come to join the fray. 
You invite the enemy into our city   We make peace with our 
enemies  not our friends.  I kill the queen s enemies. 
Yes  that s the military approach. Our queen tried to make

That is the way of the world. I m not But our queen recognizes that she erred 
by abolishing slavery So here is the queen s proposal. 
Slavery will never return to Meereen  time to adjust to the new order. 
What does that mean  years to end the practice. 
Slaveholders will be compensated In exchange  you will cut off 
your support for the Sons of the Harpy. cut it off all the same. 
I do hope you accept  my friends. instead of being drowned by it. 
And as a parting gift to See if it doesn t taste every bit 
as good as what came before.   Excellent. 
  You met with the slavers today. died fighting this scum. 
Now you invite them to our so the rulers could

When does she return  We know Torgo Nudho. 
We fight with him against the Masters. took part in these negotiations. 
As commander of the Unsullied  he is time to make peace. 
You have made peace with the slavers    Those men respect you. 
They respect me because I am not betraying her work. I 
am trying to save her city. For a short time. 
Seven years is not a Slavery is a horror that 
should be ended at once. I can t do both today. 
You are wrong to trust these men. They re trustworthy if they re convinced 
that working with me is don t understand them. 
We are not human in their eyes. we will use that to our advantage. 
You will not use them.   What

Knights I m paying you now. 
Which means Help me  
Who are you  The one true king

I  too  have lost a son. But  Davos  you were

He licks his wounds There is nothing for me

the war is over. I am sworn to no man. 
I promised you  ships and you Stannis never gives up. 
Never. His fleet lies at the bottom 
of Blackwater Bay. she sees in the flames 
and burning men alive. when Stannis returned. 
All those who spoke They say she sang 
to them as they burned. You cannot turn 
Stannis against her. You could try. 
If you fail  they ll burn you. 
And you ve only on four of my wedding days  
but I don t ask you Please  do this for me. 
When you are dead  and let your widow

You re here to remind me Your Grace...

Go on. your father set their tongues 
cast them in flames. He burned men alive 
with wildfire led to a rebellion 
that killed every Targaryen... No  Your Grace  thank the gods. 
But the Mad King gave his enemies executed without a fair trial. 
Your Grace. Besides  what else is there for me 
to do inside this fucking box  You can t. 
Cersei has offered a lordship Best part of her 
for the best part of me. Are we really going to 
spend the entire road to Volantis You re right  there s no point.

During your brief tenure as Hand. Managed to kill a lot of people  
Yes  but you showed great to leave King s Landing. 
She begged me.  Cause I liked it. 
Power... and they will never follow us. 
They find us repulsive. repulsive  which is why 
we surround ourselves And yet... 
no matter what we do... Not for long. 
You re right. How many dwarves

He executed their king by striking at you. 
Gilly wouldn t do that. All your books

from being carried out. The King s word is law.

These weren t here before. our passage. 
Gods protect us. and he only protects 
those who serve him. Perhaps we should take shelter. 
The city s on the rise  The people are behind you. 
Well  not all the people  of course. But the rebirth of Meereen is 
the cause of this violence. a city without slavery  
a city without Masters... Shall we begin  
Do we have a plan  kill every last one of their soldiers  
and return their cities to the dirt. You once told me you knew 
what your father was. and Jaime told me. 
He had caches of wildfire all the major thoroughfares. 
He would have burned every Every man  woman  and child. 
That s why Jaime killed him. The Unsullied you stole 
from Kraznys mo Nakloz The translator you stole from 
Kraznys mo Nakloz will remain Pyramid will be slaughtered. 
We obviously didn t communicate clearly. I imagine it s difficult 
adjusting to the new reality. Dracarys.

You declared war upon us. this cannot be forgiven.

souls into slaughter  I m a man of mercy. 
You re right. Only one of us. 
Let s end this the old way. about you  bastard. 
The way people in the swordsman who ever walked.

My dogs are desperate to meet you. In the morning  then  bastard. 
If he was smart  he d stay inside If they feel the tide turning... 
It s not his men that worry me. A pincer move. 
They won t be able to It s crucial that we 
let them charge at us. If we let him buckle our 
center  he ll pursue. Did you really think that cunt

We should all get some sleep. So you ve met the enemy

you and your trusted advisors  I lived with him. 
I know the way his mind works. that I might have some insight  
You re right. He won t. He s the one who lays traps. 
  He s overconfident. He s been doing it all his life. 
Aye  and what have I been doing all worse than Ramsay Bolton. 
I ve defended the Wall from All right  tell me. 
What should we do  How As long as he lives  Ramsay s claim 
to Winterfell will be contested  Listen to me  please. He

But I was wrong just like you. Jon Snow s not a king. 
No  he s not. You want some

part of his plan and nothing else. about a dwarf s height

In return  I expect you of the Iron Islands  
Not my claim. Hers. We can agree upon that at least.

We do. With the former Masters

We d like you to help us Reasonable.

  Careful now. He s right. 
Our queen exiled Jorah. If I ever kill you

I thought you knew everyone s secrets. talk about them all the time. 
I can still feel it. What if I want you to die here and now  
Then I will die. and you gave me to other 
monsters who murdered my family. Will you allow me to say 
one more thing before I go  the Tully forces and retaken Riverrun. 
You might consider seeking him out.   I have an army. 
  Your brother s army. You should go home before it s too late. 
You ll never be one of us  Lady Stark. were born to lords and ladies. 
They began as slaves   He was no one.

He brought you here  Ned Stark  and I should be your Hand. 
We men of the North are right but he smells too bloody awful. 
I die    I can. 
  You will not.   I dare yes. 
  The line of succession.   What s that mean  
  The lawful ascension. and there won t be no more trouble. 
But we had a deal all done and dusted.   Truly you should. 
Killing the man will do you no good. Show the people what 
a good king should be. I have here a decree 
from my father Tywin Lannister  The position s mine for life. 
And he s given me permission I make up for in appetite. 
So let s forget about your plight  I ve got two fucking warts on my cock. 
Well  don t worry  love. You can do better  Bianca  dear. 
You must do. You rang very false. 
I rang very false    You weren t complaining about me last night. 
  May I get you some wine  Lady Crane  intimate.   Of course we re going to be intimate. 
It s only a matter of time. And your filthy mind. 
A girl will poison the rum. of the faces from the hall... 
A girl is not ready. Seems like a decent woman. 
Does death only come for Who wants her dead  
That does not matter. She s jealous because Lady Crane is better. 
A girl must decide if she wants A servant does not ask questions. 
No  No  No  We were at war. 
We were being slaughtered. From whom  
From you. In his name we gather today 
to choose a new king as our leader. daughter of Balon Greyjoy  
King of the Iron Islands.   Not once. 
  There are many things we ve never done. The great lords 
of Westeros pay us no mind  i   We are a sea people. 
  Aye   i  Yes  you are  
A woman will not lead us. I am Theon Greyjoy... 
last living son of Balon Greyjoy. Those of you that have sailed under her  
and there are many of you here   i   She is a reaver. 
  Aye   i   i   She is ironborn  
  Aye   i   i Yara  Yara  Yara   i  
I m Euron Greyjoy. Nephew. 
Little Theon. Captured a castle you couldn t keep. 
Got yourself taken prisoner. a woman can be king. 
  When did you return  Uncle  Long overdue. 
I m glad you re here. To execute the man who killed my father. 
I did. a rope bridge and watched him fall. 
He was leading us nowhere No one loved him. 
No one wanted to follow him. not killing him years ago. 
That would have been hard to do. around the world having a grand old time. 
Gallivanting  Did the great lords of Westeros 
teach you words like that  Being ironborn. Leading ironborn. 
Getting ready to bring us back to glory. the world has ever seen. 
Right idea  except I m the one who knows how to use it. 
I ve been all over the world. the great lords of Westeros just as much as we do. 
Someone with a large army  and I m going to gallivant right over 
and give it to Daenerys Targaryen seduce the Dragon Queen  
I m not going to seduce her.  i Euron  Euron  Euron  Euron   i  
 i Euron  Euron  Euron   i   i Bless him with salt.  i  
 i Bless him with stone.  i   i Let the old Euron drown.  i  
 i Let his lungs fill with seawater.  i  but rises again harder and stronger.  i  
What is dead may never die. Let s go murder them. 
They stole our best ships. And you saved my life. 
So I can t take you back Is there a cure  
I don t know. But I ve seen what happens 
when it goes far enough.   I m so sorry. 
  Don t be. I love you. 
I ll always love you. Jorah the Andal. 
You have not been dismissed. for the rest of your life. 
Well  I command you to find the cure and then return to me. 
When I take the Seven Kingdoms  our pact with the Masters  
how many killings have been And how many Masters have 
been butchered by the free men  So it s safe to say that a 
fragile peace has taken hold. we get in our profession. 
It s not enough. It s not enough for 
Meereen to have peace. The Sons of the Harpy have a good story. 
Resist the foreign invaders. Breaker of Chains and all that. 
The people know who brought them security  
Who brought about someone they know 
cannot be bought or influenced. how uncomfortable the journey can be. 
The truth is we need your help. You don t need to persuade me. 
I came to help. From the fire she was 
reborn to remake the world. burning their sins and flesh away. 
Ideally we d avoid purifying followers of many different faiths. 
You want your queen Daenerys has been sent to lead 
the people against the darkness   That sounds most excellent. 
  A man named Stannis Baratheon He  too  had a glorious destiny. 
He attacked King s Landing and was he had been defeated again  
this time at Winterfell support you could provide the queen. 
I suppose it s hard for a point of being a fanatic  
You re always right. But men and women make mistakes. 
Even honest servants of the Lord. than the priestess who counseled Stannis  
My friend has a healthy skepticism of religion  and where they are for a reason. 
Terrible things happen for a reason. bring his light into the world. 
Knowledge has made you powerful. what you heard that night

Should I tell you what the voice said  We serve the same queen. 
If you are her true friend  He saw me  the Night King  
  He saw me  He can now. 
His mark is on you. Help me with the sledge. 
Hodor.   The time for what  
For you to become me. We can t defend the north from 
the walkers and the south from the Boltons. Aside from the Starks and the Boltons  
the most powerful houses in the North The Umbers and the Karstarks 
have already declared for the Boltons  They can hang. 
But the Karstarks declared for Ramsay know that a Stark beheaded their father. 
I don t think we the North  Ser Davos  
Precious little  my lady. More loyal  more suspicious of outsiders. 
They may well be loyal  when they betrayed your family  
I may not know the North  of the world and even the bravest of them 
don t want to see their wives them to fight alongside him  
they need to believe other houses in the North... 
Glover  Mormont  Cerwyn  Together they equal all the others. 
We can start small and build. People will still risk everything for it  from 
White Harbor to Ramsay s own door. No  but I do.

Not the same as our men  which they will be. 
I just saw the Dothraki fight. I ve ever seen. 
Killing our men wasn t war a thousand wagons. 
Qyburn s scorpion fired I sit on her father s throne  
the father you betrayed What sort of offer 
do you think she d make  by way of apology for 
murdering our father and son. you saw his body. 
I m not talking about Father.   After all this time  it still amazes me that you   
  It was Olenna. Which one would Margaery have 
been better able to control  of the Seven Kingdoms  
She was telling the truth. She should have died screaming. 
She s dead  like her son  And if we don t find a way out 
of this war  we ll follow them. I know my choice. 
A soldier should know his. I was thinking of  but... 
but  yes  they are. No matter how big they get 
or how terrifying today than I did yesterday. 
You re not sure How many men did your army kill 
taking Winterfell back We both want to help people. 
We can only help them When you first came here  
Ser Davos said you took a knife So  it was a figure of speech  
Your Grace. an old friend. 
I served with your father. You found a cure  
I wouldn t be here if I hadn t. if you ll have me. 
It would be my honor. I put very little stock 
in it myself. especially when winter comes. 
I remember Wolkan. Eh  the North has dulled 
many good maesters  wits. beyond the Wall  
thanks to the magical help   Still  we ought to write back   
  Brandon Stark. I led him through 
the Wall years ago. Somehow  a crippled boy 
survived for years beyond the work to discipline your mind. 
I sense a more detailed trusts and respects you. 
If you tell people the threat to search every word 
of every faded scroll that lets us defeat 
the Army of the Dead for good. is part of a ploy 
by the Dragon Queen to open those lands 
to easy conquest. talking to cripples. 
Archmaester  please. We will write to Maester Wolkan 
at Winterfell for clarification. the charlatan who claimed descent 
from the children of the forest. rise up and destroy Aegon the Conqueror. 
Ah  Lodos. I m afraid so. 
Horrible business. All rulers demand 
that people bend the knee. a man who had taken up 
arms against her. alongside his son  
I am her Hand  not her head. That s what I used to tell 
myself about her father. I was only a purveyor 
of information. I m not the one doing it. 
When the pitch of their Daenerys is not her father. 
And she never will be to make her listen. 
  Who s that for  It s a sealed scroll 
for the King in the North. I thought Arya was dead. 
I thought Bran was dead. Bran saw the Night King 
and his army The Wall has kept them out for 
thousands of years  presumably. have enough men. 
We ll fight And give the country to Cersei  
As soon as I march away  What if we prove her wrong  
I don t think she ll come see Only one soldier. 
Is that possible  Black from beyond the Wall. 
Bring one of these things and is somehow convinced 
not to murder us I m warning you  
I m not a fighter. one of these dead men. 
Fair point. I ll go north and take one. 
You asked me to find a The Free Folk will help us. 
They know the real north They won t have to. 
You can t lead a raid who knows them. 
I haven t given you I don t need your permission. 
I am a king. have your men behead me 
or your dragons burn me alive. because I knew it was the 
best chance for my people  to trust in a stranger... 
because it s our best chance. We did not choose you 
to rule us  my lady. here for you  Lady Stark. 
Aye. He is doing what 
he thinks is best. and expect it to just sit 
and wait for him like Ghost. Well  he s not making it easy. 
The Northern lords are proud. And  
Nothing.   Say what you mean. 
You always liked nice things. Are you angry with me  
They were insulting Jon  which is my responsibility 
as Lady of Winterfell. Glover has  men  
Royce has  . Not if they lose 
their heads first. We took it back  
and the Mormonts All of us  working together. 
Now  I m sure cutting off get people to work together. 
And if Jon doesn t come back  to give you 
what you really want. You re thinking it right now. 
You don t want to be  I have work to do. 
My lady. Last time I was here  you 
killed my son with wildfire. The guards 
hardly ever patrol it. I ve got my own business 
in Flea Bottom. Best hurry. 
We don t have time for this. Why down here  
I don t think that thing yet. 
Today might be the day swinging it at me. 
I ll leave you to it. never agree to meet. 
You made me look by hitting Casterly Rock  
but you were completely unsentimental. 
Father would have been proud. I once told Bronn 
that if I ever saw you with a sparring sword. 
He was going to execute me. because of anything I did  
he hated me sent to punish him. 
Did he   to be born this way  
  Did he think I chose it   You re a military man. 
You must know there s She s even willing 
to suspend the hostilities If you want Cersei 
to bend the knee  And Daenerys doesn t. 
Not right now  anyway. I wasn t sure I d find you. 
Thought you might Nothing fucks you 
harder than time. and I never get a second look. 
But you were right. Don t be so sure. 
Safety is never a permanent You came to get me. 
You want me to come with you. I m ready. 
  You   what you re heading into. 
What do you think How happy I am making weapons 
for the family I d know it when it comes. 
You might want to bring about swinging swords. 
But this... to yourself. 
Situation s complicated I told you  Clovis  if we 
don t get out of here soon  No weapons  friends. 
I promise.   It is. 
  The docks are that way. to avoid good men 
such as yourselves. You must be even older 
than you look. I can t say it was a pleasure 
doing business with you.   Wine  
  Mm. Come have a look.

But before he gets spoon of that into his mouth. 
Five minutes later  I d hurry to your

Where d you get that scar  We was looking for a dwarf with 
a scar like that a while back. Arrangement  
You gonna arrange to pay us He ll do. 
Go  go  go. Ser Jaime.

your knowledge or consent. happens in this city 
without me knowing  I ve come to believe that

She has the numbers. If we want to like Father would have. 
Dead men  dragons  we will defeat it. 
For ourselves  for our house  You. 
People won t like that. The lion does not concern himself 
with the opinions of the sheep.   The king s got a lot on his mind. 
  I understand.   You don t have to worry. 
  You re just Clovis  before he heads off to work 
at the Winterfell forges. You survived King s Landing. 
Yet again. Your I m Robert Baratheon s son. 
Bastard son. Our fathers trusted each other. 
Why shouldn t we  I met yours in my shop. 
  You re a lot leaner. All I ever knew is that 
they fought together and won. Let me come with you. 
Don t be a fool. And he won t be needing a 
smith with a sword like that. I prefer a hammer. 
He can handle himself.  It s better to be 
a coward for a minute  I can t wait out this war. 
Yeah  nobody mind me. All right  come on. 
You may not believe it  Not even Grey Worm. 
This is the coin and pay us  remember  
It was supposed to last us But bring it back. 
Our queen needs you. Your Grace  I... 
If I don t return  at least  . 
Guess how many windows are That s true. 
This High Septon Maynard  his own bowel movements. 
What does  annulment  mean  Maynard says here that he issued 
an annulment for a Prince  Ragger  in a secret ceremony in Dorne. 
Is that a common thing they set me to the task of preserving 
that man s window counting while the secret to 
defeating the Night King s But that s all right  isn t it  
We can all become slavering  murderous to the full records 
of High Septon Maynard s That number was the steps. 
Are you sure only copy in Winterfell  
Uh  yes  my lord. Isn t it your 
job to talk him out I ve been failing 
at that job of late. And you need to convince 
the one with the dragons Both. 
How many men did you bring  We were hoping some of 
your men could help. I m a liability out there  
as you well know. Again  
You re not the only ones. They want to go 
beyond the Wall  too. Our Lord told us that 
the Great War is coming   to be murdered. 
Thoros  They won t give me anything 
to drink down here. You returned the favor  
as I recall. It doesn t matter 
what we think our reasons are. For fuck s sake  
will you shut your hole  what we re doing  
Is it worse than sitting in a We re all on the same side. 
How can we be  Tormund  Haven t been North before  
Gendry  Never seen snow before. Tormund  Down south the air smells like pig shit. 
Jon  You ve never been down south. Gendry  How do you live up here  
...How d you keep your balls that s the secret. 
...Walking s good  Jon  There s not a living woman 
within  miles from here. looking for the dead. 
Tormund  So  you ve met this Dragon queen  huh  Proud man. 
The King Beyond the Wall and everything. Beric  We re fighting a great war. 
..Wars cost money. she stripped me naked... 
Hound  Sounds alright so far... Thoros  She needed your blood. 
Gendry to Thoros   Yes  thank you  I know that. Your lips are moving and you complain 
about something. That s winging. Good lad. 
The first time I went north of the Wall  He deserved a better son. 
Were you with him at the end  I want you to know that  
every mutineer found justice. have died to protect every one of those men. 
And they butchered him. I have ever met. 
He was good  all the way through. you know. 
I heard. I m glad he didn t catch you. 
Your father gave me this sword. Lord Commander Mormont thought 
you d never come back to Westeros. It s not right for me to have it. 
He gave it to you. I broke my father s heart. 
I forfeited the right to claim his sword. And your children after you. 
Father used to watch us from up here. you were inside knitting all the time. 
I remember. I came out here after 
and Bran had left his bow behind  cuffed him if he saw. 
There was one arrow in the target So I started shooting. 
And every shot I had to go up there and get my Finally  I ve hit the bull s eye. 
Could ve been the  shot. Or the . And I heard this. clapping sound  
I looked up. I knew what I was doing 
was against the rules The rules were wrong. 
I was doing what I was meant Killed by the Lannisters. 
With your help. Our good King Robert is dead. 
  Killed from wounds he took in a bull...   Father has been charged with treason. 
He conspired with Robert s brothers The Lannisters are treating me well 
and providing me with every comfort. and prevent any strife between the 
great houses of Lannister and Stark   Did they  
With a knife at your throat  You should have known what it was like. 
I was a child. I remember you  standing on that platform 
with Joffrey and Cersei when they wearing  the fancy way you did your hair. 
  You were there. And what did you do  Did you 
come running to the rescue    I wanted to. 
  But you didn t. I didn t betray my entire family 
for my beloved Joffrey. again because of me. 
You didn t win it back  Jon didn t win it and they rode north for me. 
While you were off where  Travelling the world  Well  while you were training  I 
suffered things you can never imagine. You never would have 
survived what I survived. I don t know yet. 
Who did you show it to  What are you scared of  
You didn t commit any crimes.   Arya  
  and he ll be angry. you were just a scared little girl. 
All alone with the wicked Lannisters. This is exactly what she 
wants  what she always wanted. They wouldn t think much of Lady Sansa 
if they knew how she did Cersei s bidding. were when you wrote this. 
Are you going to say  But Sometimes anger makes people 
do unfortunate things. Were your born mean or 
you just hate wildlings  Fuck off. 
I don t think you re truly mean.   Dick  
  Cock. Bet you do. 
Nop  it s pussy for me. If I ever get back there. 
Yellow hair  Almost as tall as you. 
Brienne of Tarth  Well  not with her yet. 
But I see the way she looks at me. up and eat your liver  
You do know her. Think of them. 
Great big monsters. live this long  
I m good at killing people. Your father. 
I suppose you favor your mother. When he was Hand. 
He sent me off hunting for the Mountain. Thoros has brought me back 
six times. The North did not raise you from the dead. 
The Lord of Light never spoke to me. He wants you alive. 
  Why  I don t know. 
So what s the point of serving a god  I don t think it s our purpose to understand. 
Except one thing. I m not fighting so some man or woman I barely 
know can sit in a throne made of swords. The enemy always wins. 
And we still need to fight him. joy while we re here. 
But we can keep up the life.  I am the shield that 
guards the realms of men.  A mountain like an arrow head. 
Are you sure  I once charged through the Mud Gate 
of King s Landing. You can do the stupidest bravest thing... 
It s interesting  these heroes you name... if all goes well  I ll finally 
get to meet your sister. Oh... 
first she d torture you in some believe me. 
But if we go to the capital  and anyone touches you  
King s Landing burns down of how to set a trap. 
Of course she is. Are we  
Laying any traps  I m not sure deceit and mass murder 
are the best ways to start. you re going to win the throne. 
You need to inspire a degree of fear. And Joffrey. 
It makes their power brittle. Aegon Targaryen got quite 
a long way on fear. of breaking the wheel. 
Aegon built the wheel. other tyrants that came before you  
So we walk into the lion s den  Forgive me  but I don t care 
about any Lannister promises. I d keep you from doing anything impulsive. 
Impulsive  want to see us both headless. 
My sister is likely to say And you ve been known to lose 
your temper from time to time. Burning the Tarlys for instance. 
That was not impulsive.   Perhaps. 
Perhaps the father needed taking your family s side in this debate. 
I am taking their side. Because I believe in you 
and the world you want to build. Probably not in a single lifetime. 
How do we ensure your vision endures  You want to know who sits on the 
Iron Throne after I m dead  of choosing a successor. 
The Night s Watch has one method  We will discuss the succession 
after I wear the crown. and I saw hundred of arrows miss. 
But any one of them could have death quite a bit  haven t you  
Is this one of the items you ve discussed The bears have blue eyes. 
We have to get him back to Eastwatch. Alright. 
I just got bit by a dead bear. Funny old life. 
Alright then. She seems very resourceful. 
You re worried. find a good reason to go home. 
You question their loyalty  heard from him in weeks. 
You re the Lady of Winterfell. Wisely. 
Ably. Yes  they turned their backs on Jon 
when it was time to retake Winterfell She s your sister. 
You may have disagreements  Perhaps Lady Brienne can help. 
She s sworn to protect both She would. 
Something I ve always wanted to know. through the bridge on Pyke  
For being honest  I don t remember about it the next morning. 
Some damn good scrap. I ever saw. 
Just the drunkest.   I m not leaving you. 
  You re the fastest. Give it  
Give it  What happened  
Where are the others  Get the maester  Now  
Thoros  We have to burn this body. 
And all the clothes behind him. Come to us in our darkness. 
For the night is dark and full of terrors. When you killed the white walker  
almost all the dead that followed him     . We can go for the walkers. 
  Maybe we ll stand a chance. There s a raven flying for Dragonstone now. 
Daenerys is our only chance. Kill him. 
He turned them all. he brought me back... 
No one else  just us. This is your last life. 
I ve been waiting for the end for a long time. Can t see why the Lord of Light 
should be any different. It s an invitation. 
To King s Landing. And you will represent my interest 
at this gathering as you see them. Cersei Lannister is queen. 
They want another Stark prisoner  I have work to do here. 
It s not safe. I m not worried about me. 
It s not safe leaving to them all behind your back  
Let me at least leave Podrick I do not need to be watched 
over or minded or cared for. If I abandon you... 
The trip to King s Landing on summer roads. 
The sooner you leave  the better You can t  
The most important person in the world can t   No one. 
They knew the risk when they left.   So what would you have me do  
  Nothing. If you die 
we re all lost. and I ve listened to you. 
I m not doing nothing again. Fall back  
Fall back  Jon  
Go  Fucking hope not. 
It s time to go  Your Grace.   My faces. 
  Where did you get them  What does that mean  
Back in Braavos  before The game of faces. 
It s simple  I ask you a sound like the truth. 
If you fool me  you win. Those faces  what are they  
Is that what you should be asking  for the last person who asked me questions. 
Tell me what they are  You wanted to be a queen. 
To sit next to a handsome young king To pick up a sword like 
father and go off to battle. The world doesn t just let girls 
decide what they are going to be. I can become someone else. 
Speak in their voice  live in their skin. to wear those pretty dresses. 
To be the Lady of Winterfell. I don t. 
If we hadn t gone I wouldn t have seen. The dragons are my children. 
They re the only children I ll ever have. And we ll do it together. 
You have my word. Who was the last person who called me that  
I m not sure  is it my brother  Not Dany. 
How about  My Queen   What about those who 
swore allegiance to you  I hope I deserve it. 
You do. Then it s a distraction. 
  They re growing fast.  i The greatest slave soldiers  i

I encountered a situation which may have some bearing   
Why don t you shut your mouth He is your king. 
Robb knows I wouldn t let you wave 
your blunders around scurrying back to Casterly Rock with 
his tail between his legs. It s not about glory. 
Your instructions were to wait What value was the mill  
The Mountain was garrisoned Of course not. 
We took the fight to him. the Mountain into the west  
into our country where which he would have done 
because he is a mad dog I could have that head

Martyn Lannister. Martyn is   I believe. 
Tywin Lannister has my sisters. great grandsons

grateful to you  my lord. She has always been...

about managing it. and smelled her there     
    She kicked and wailed  from her hair     
    From there to here  and covered with hair

You d be wise not to resist. You think I care

If I had a proper forge  It just has to keep

No one s put any chains on you. for Ned Stark s daughter. 
You re lucky we found you. Better than anyone

Yeah  you  too. burn your fingers. 
Good bye  Hot Pie.  i Hey  Hot Pie.  i  
It s really good. for forgetting we re at war. 
It often comforts me to think from the day you left. 
Maybe he never said it Your father 
was a stubborn old ox. had the patience. 
I m glad you were with him. After  years of fighting  
I don t think he remembered calling myself Blackfish. 
He said it was an old joke I told him people had been 
calling me Blackfish Every time he would leave 
for the capital to you.  
And I would sit at this window I wonder 
how many times of Winterfell 
waiting for me to return. We don t know the truth. 
They could be in hiding. He s got to remain strong 
if he s to prevail. You re Robb Stark s wife. 
Hold still. True. 
And he eats the flesh My husband 
doesn t eat children. tonight  is it  
See  We re all the same to them

Take Orell and  good men. defenses better than any of us. 
And if he s useful  good. See if crows can fly. 
We re finally going to war  When I give the signal  
hit them in the night. but it only guards one side. 
  We ll meet again.   Ah. 
How will we see your signal  When it s time  I m going 
to light the biggest fire  i than you went north with.  i  
We can talk inside.  i Tether it and I ll be inside.  i  
 i Keep your eyes  i  Bet you feed that pig

Well  look at him.  i Sharpen these for me  would ya   i  
 i I see the head.  i   i You re nearly there.  i  
One more push should do it. You re sure  
Ride east.   Come on. 
Come on.  i The fires will show me.  i  
  How long will you be gone  I will never abandon you. 
You are the Son of Fire. They re laughing at me 
the way Renly laughed at me. Make me another son. 
I cannot. It would kill you. 
I m not so easily killed. Your fires burn low  my king. 
There is another way. requires a king s blood. 
  Yes. But there are others 
with your blood in their veins. but first there must 
be sacrifices. is a warning  Your Grace. 
  To whom  Give me your water. 
Khaleesi  this man  i Leave this place  Your Grace.  i  
Leave tonight  I beg you. If you want to sit on the throne your 
ancestors built  you must win it. The blood of my enemies  
not the blood of innocents. I was in King s Landing 
after the sack  khaleesi. Babies  children  old men. 
More women raped and it stirs when you put 
a sword in his hand. They do not put cities to the sword 
unless they re ordered to do so. because they believed in him  
because they loved him  I fought beside the last dragon 
on that day  Your Grace. I did  Your Grace. 
Finest man I ever met. All  
Did this one s ears I want to buy them all. 
There are   Unsullied Yes.  . 
 i And the ones  i  upon all of Astapor. 
I will have them all I ll need the boys to pick 
up the swords they drop. Your ship will buy you 
 Unsullied.  i is worth .  i  
But good Master Kraznys you have with you   
The Dothraki you have are not  i you three Unsullied  i  
 i for all of them.  i  You will win the throne 
with dragons  not slaves  Your Grace.   One. 
  Two.   Done. 
  Done. Kraznys  gift to me. 
A token of a bargain more than any army. 
Aegon Targaryen proved that. but if you ever question me 
in front of strangers again  Is that understood  
 i Do you have a name   i  No  Your Grace. 
No family living. Yes  Your Grace. 
Lying is a great offense. I offered water to one of the slaves 
dying on the Walk of Punishment. There are no masters 
in the grave  Your Grace. about the Unsullied  
About their obedience  They obey  that is all. 
 i Once they are yours   i  if you command it. 
And what about you  But we are not men. 
 i A surprising place to keep  i  This is the safest place 
in the city.  i Thank you  my dear.  i  
 i Pod.  i    I ll be there in a moment. 
  Yes  my lord. Only my life. 
Not all that significant  If only the Master of Coin 
had such power. Our redheaded friend. 
You secured her release Of course. 
A simple misunderstanding. of special relationship. 
We don t. Why don t you ask her  
Any advice for me If I had a gold dragon 
for every time I heard Good point. 
They re only numbers. it s easy to make them behave. 
Trivial even. I ve tried quite a few. 
Well  lots of work to do. Come on. 
Tonight  then. is dull reading. 
It s an opinion I share with Unless he made it all up  yes. 
  Podrick  do keep up.   Yes  my lord  
After a long consultation a suitable reward 
for the services you ve   No  my lord. 
  Wonderful. She s not bad with 
second timers  either. for putting your spear 
through my would be killer s face  for staying by my side 
as the battle raged You didn t tell me 
he was handsome. in certain circles. 
 i One of four women in the world  i  My lord  I don t even... 
 i She s here to thank you  i  who s never once failed 
to address me as  my lord.  For years I ve heard 
that Littlefinger he rubs his hands together 
and  poof  mountains of gold. We can t afford to pay it back  
that s what s wrong with it. Seeing as it s his grandson s 
ass on the throne  Forgive a debt  my father  
For a man of the world  you return it with interest. 
And what if I don t  This is why 
I don t lend you money. It s the Iron Bank of Braavos. 
We owe them tens of millions. One way or another  
they always get their gold back. Does he have a little 
jaunt in his step  I trust you got 
your money s worth. Oh  it was a gift  Podrick. 
This is more than You don t pay him. 
Oh  then it s much more Maybe they re trying 
to curry some favor to turn down gold  
They were happy enough I didn t tell them anything. 
  What did you do to them  to like these things  
Yes  my lord. Sit down  Podrick. 
We re going to need details. Come on  
Come on  You know how we deal 
with runaways here  do you  No  no  no  
I m gonna fuck you No  no  no  
No  don t  I ll take the big bitch first. 
When she s good and wet  Lady Catelyn Stark commanded me 
to deliver Ser Jaime a treasonous cunt. 
 i Orders were to take  i  You re only making it worse. 
 i Take her over there  i  Come on  
You know who she is  don t you  Never been with 
a woman that big. is Lord Selwyn Tarth. 
Heard of Tarth  Do you know why  
Every sapphire in Westeros    i The blue ones.  i  
  I know what they are. Bring her back here. 
 i Yes  my lord.  i   i Come on  on your feet.  i  
 i Unbesmirched.  i  I hated to read as a child  
 i but my father forced me  i   i with sword or horse.  i  
Two hours every day holed up in You ll be a rich man 
till the end of your days. Lands  titles   
you ll have them all. You understand that. 
We have the numbers. Fighting bravely 
for a losing cause is far more rewarding. 
Hard to argue with that. I wonder if you need 
to keep me chained to this tree.  i Come on  men.  i  
Suppose you ll be wanting  i I think we ve got a spare  i  
 i partridge on the fire.  i  and the carving knife. 
Will this work Yes  this will do nic

Sansa came to court On her knees  
begging for me  hmmm. before they cut my balls off 
with a hot knife   They taught me that 
each man has a role to play. I am the master 
of whisperers. I could. 
But will I  I m no hero. 
What do you want  with an army of Northmen  
Loyal lad   Robb  
He s just a boy. But the man giving Cersei 
sleepless nights Lord Stannis has the best 
claim to the Throne  Stannis Baratheon 
is Robert s true heir. Tsk tsk. Sansa pleaded 
so sweetly for your life  Cersei is no fool. 
She knows a tame wolf is more woman who murdered my King  
who butchered my men  to lay down his sword 
and proclaim Joffrey as a man of honor. 
If you give her and your bastard son. 
You think my life is and you learned it well. 
But I grew up a long time ago. 
Pity. daughter s life  My Lord  
 i Is that a precious  i  We can t risk Lord Walder 
sending word of your movements We can t expect his support  
Expect nothing of Walder Frey  i Father rots  i  
 i in a dungeon.  i  We need to cross the Trident 
and we need to do it now. We ve got five times his numbers. 
You can take the Twins if you have to. The Freys have held 
the crossing for  years  Have my horse 
saddled and ready. Or throw you in a dungeon. 
Or slit your throat. Whatever it took. 
If I m going doing my bargaining for me. 
I agree. I have known Lord Walder 
since I was a girl.  i Unless there was  i  
 i a profit in it.  i  again after so many years  My Lord. 
Oh spare me. What am I supposed 
to do with you  Father  please   
I need lessons in courtesy be a milkmaid 
if I hadn t squirted you you come forward. 
There. Now that I ve observed  i of shutting their mouths.  i  
Is there somewhere right now. 
Fine. I m sure she will 
give you many sons. The fine Lord Tully 
would never marry any were reasons why   
I didn t need reasons. You see how they pile up  
Why are you here  My Lord  
so my son and his bannermen may cross If you could climb 
your own battlements  They ll be   corpses 
when Tywin Lannister gets here. Your husband s in a cell 
beneath the Red Keep You swore an oath 
to my father. if I remember right. 
Joffrey s King now  but rebels  it seems to me. 
If I had the sense than a bear... 
So I had a new pommel made. as a bear  I think. 
This is Valyrian steel. The Mormonts have carried it 
for five centuries. He brought dishonor 
to our House  before he fled 
from Westeros. Oh  you can 
and you will. A bloody dead man 
tried to kill me...   Is that understood  
  Yes  My Lord. to Ser Alliser tonight. 
No you won t  The hand that your wolf

And  is done... 
You will marry  i I did.  i

And this is my day  Oh  it hurts  boy. 
Oh yes. No one knows.

As I have. with Lord Frey s levies

I want you to share my tent. rub my legs when they re

I swear it. Some magic. 
There is a spell. Do it. 
Save him. whatever you want. 
It s not a matter of gold. My death  
No. Khaleesi  
do not do this thing. Go now  
  Take her and leave. Irriya  
You must go also  lady. The dead will

Are you in agony    You look like you re in agony. 
The fire is burning Damn you  woman. 
Are you immune to pain  Let s play a new game. 
There s a Braavosi knife game for losing fingers  
  Not if you win. no knife games. 
Let s do something I happen to be a great 
judge of character.  i Here s how it works   i  
 i I make a statement  i  you drink. 
If I m wrong  I drink. I don t want to play 
this game. Your father beat you. 
But my mother before you were . 
It was a woman. Work. 
And... foreign beauty. 
I don t want to play. Your mother 
was a whore. Your father left the family when 
you were very young  And we ve established 
the rules about lying  You wanted 
a different life. The whole shit stained world 
could drink off that one. but how would you get there  
I don t believe the life a lowborn girl to do  
Drink. And don t talk about 
my mother and father ever My dear lady  if I have 
offended you  I apologize. Ask away. 
Try to penetrate   That s not how the game works. 
I don t care the way used to be married. 
  Married  This night. 
It s not   I m guessing the lady and I 
can tell more unpleasant stories I was . My brother Jaime 
and I were riding clothes half torn off 
with two men on her heels. She was too scared to send off 
on her own  a wheelwright s orphan. 
And she was hungry   how I was always waiting 
for them to laugh at me handsome brother. 
I forgot about myself in her bed. 
For three chickens  what the hell I was doing. 
But she was good to me. And by morning I was deep enough 
in love to ask for her hand. and there you have it   
man and wife. and told my father. 
I imagine that was Jaime had arranged 
the whole thing  He thought it was time 
I had a woman. How many whores command 
that kind of price  and rolling 
onto the floor. You should have known 
she was a whore. and in love   
A girl who into her bed two hours later. 
As I said  I was young and stupid. 
Hyah  You re sleeping 
through the war. They re a mile north. 
   i Get my squire   i  You ll be dead. 
How will you know  Move  
Out of the way  I was born lucky. 
Tribesmen of the Vale  And painted dogs  
Your dominion over what is yours  
Half man  Half man  Half man  Half man  
To battle. How did our 
tribesmen do   i getting along.  i  
 i You re wounded.  i  Hmph. 
The scouts were wrong. With his other   men. 
And where are they  My Lady  
Hyah hyah  Lady Stark. 
I d offer you my sword  It s not your sword I want. 
Give me my daughters back. I m afraid. 
 i Kill him  Robb.  i  you saw him. 
He s more use and put him in irons. 
We could end this war You fight for the Starks  
I fight for the Lannisters. and let s end this 
here and now. you d win. 
We re not doing it Aye. But the dead 
won t hear them. Did we free my father  
Did we rescue my sisters who want us on our knees  
This war is far from over. or any of them. 
Three coppers. Piss off now. 
Go on.   Or any burnt ones  
  Piss off  They re taking him 
to the Sept of Baelor.   Traitor  
  Coward  Traitor  
Traitor  and Hand of the King. 
I come before you  i and men.  i  
 i I betrayed the faith  i  of my friend Robert. 
I swore to protect for myself. 
Traitor  of the Realm. 
As we sin  confessed his crimes 
in sight but beloved Baelor 
taught us What is to be done 
with this traitor  in permanent exile. 
And My Lady Sansa But they have 
the soft hearts of women. Daddy  
Someone stop him    Don t look  
  Let me go.   Look at me  
  Stop  Daddy   i Stop   i  
Stop him  stop  A wall of ice. 
The Wall. and the army of the dead 
is the Wall  Last time we saw The Night King  
it was at Hardhome.   Jon left you in charge  
  He did. Do you fight with us... 
or with the foreign savages If you use them to melt castles 
and burn cities  Ending the war. 
Killing her. And  
Listen to me  cunt. She has two more. 
If she decides to use them  I m not gonna be around 
when those things I have to tell Cersei. 
May as well jump That I ve come 
to destroy your cities  and orphan your children. 
That s Cersei Lannister  not me. is the wheel that has 
rolled over rich and poor I offer you a choice   
bend the knee and join me. When she murdered 
your rightful queen You  on the other hand  
murdered your own father One with no ties to this land... 
with an army of savages your honor for your life. 
I respect that. Whatever else he is  
he is a true soldier. You are not my queen. 
You will have to kill me  too. A stupid boy. 
I am Dickon Tarly  Bend the knee. 
I will not. like a few weeks in a dark cell. 
I meant what I said. If that becomes an option  
many will take it. Your Grace  if you start 
beheading entire families   Lord Randyll 
Tarly  Dickon Tarly  Breaker of Chains  
and Mother of Dragons  My   my lord... 
How many men did we lose  It s not only armies 
that win wars. We can buy mercenaries. 
Not the same as our men  which they will be. 
I just saw the Dothraki fight. a thousand wagons. 
Qyburn s scorpion fired And she has three of them. 
This isn t a war we can win. I sit on her father s throne  
the father you betrayed What sort of offer 
do you think she d make  by way of apology for 
murdering our father and son. you saw his body. 
I m not talking about Father.   After all this time  it still amazes me that you   
  It was Olenna. If you were Olenna  
would you rather have seen Which one would Margaery have 
been better able to control  of the Seven Kingdoms  
She was telling the truth. She should have died screaming. 
She s dead  like her son  And if we don t find a way out 
of this war  we ll follow them. I know my choice. 
A soldier should know his. I was thinking of  but... 
but  yes  they are. No matter how big they get 
or how terrifying today than I did yesterday. 
You re not sure How many men did your army kill 
taking Winterfell back We both want to help people. 
We can only help them When you first came here  
Ser Davos said you took a knife So  it was a figure of speech  
Your Grace. an old friend. 
I served with your father. You found a cure  
I wouldn t be here if I hadn t. if you ll have me. 
It would be my honor. I put very little stock 
in it myself. especially when winter comes. 
I remember Wolkan. or the company. 
A crippled boy   Still  we ought to write back   
  Brandon Stark. I led him through 
the Wall years ago. Somehow  a crippled boy 
survived for years beyond the not the wildlings  no one. 
Perhaps we ought to listen work to discipline your mind. 
I sense a more detailed trusts and respects you. 
If you tell people the threat to send their men north 
to hold the Wall  they ll do it. to search every word 
of every faded scroll that lets us defeat 
the Army of the Dead for good. could be authentic. 
It s possible. is part of a ploy 
by the Dragon Queen to open those lands 
to easy conquest. talking to cripples. 
Archmaester  please. We will write to Maester Wolkan 
at Winterfell for clarification.   Archmaester  please   
  That will be all  Tarly. the charlatan who claimed descent 
from the children of the forest. rise up and destroy Aegon the Conqueror. 
Ah  Lodos. I m afraid so. 
Horrible business. He s a good lad. 
Right. All rulers demand 
that people bend the knee. a man who had taken up 
arms against her. alongside his son  
I am her Hand  not her head. That s what I used to tell 
myself about her father. I was only a purveyor 
of information. I m not the one doing it. 
When the pitch of their When their hair caught fire

  Who s that for  It s a sealed scroll 
for the King in the North. I thought Arya was dead. 
I thought Bran was dead. Bran saw the Night King 
and his army The Wall has kept them out for 
thousands of years  presumably. have enough men. 
We ll fight And give the country to Cersei  
As soon as I march away  What if we prove her wrong  
I don t think she ll come see Only one soldier. 
Is that possible  Black from beyond the Wall. 
Bring one of these things Anything you bring back

Fair point. I ll go north and take one. 
You asked me to find a anymore  you re King in the North. 
I m the only one here have your men behead me 
or your dragons burn me alive. because I knew it was the 
best chance for my people  to trust in a stranger... 
because it s our best chance. We did not choose you 
to rule us  my lady. here for you  Lady Stark. 
Aye. He is doing what 
he thinks is best. and expect it to just sit 
and wait for him like Ghost. Well  he s not making it easy. 
The Northern lords are proud. And  
Nothing.   Say what you mean. 
You always liked nice things. Are you angry with me  
They were insulting Jon  which is my responsibility 
as Lady of Winterfell. Glover has  men  
Royce has  . We took it back  
and the Mormonts All of us  working together. 
Now  I m sure cutting off get people to work together. 
And if Jon doesn t come back  You re thinking it right now. 
You don t want to be  I have work to do. 
My lady. Last time I was here  you 
killed my son with wildfire. The guards 
hardly ever patrol it. I ve got my own business 
in Flea Bottom. Best hurry. 
We don t have time for this. The Dothraki are coming. 
All the more reason Dothraki  year olds. 
Well  I seem to recall them giving Why down here  
I don t think that thing yet. 
Today might be the day swinging it at me. 
I ll leave you to it. never agree to meet. 
You made me look by hitting Casterly Rock

  Did he think I chose it   You re a military man. 
You must know there s If you want Cersei 
to bend the knee  And Daenerys doesn t. 
Not right now  anyway. I wasn t sure I d find you. 
Thought you might taverns  brothels. 
Should have known to come about the gold cloaks  
Haven t been here in years. Nothing fucks you 
harder than time. and I never get a second look. 
But you were right. Don t be so sure. 
Safety is never a permanent You came to get me. 
You want me to come with you. what you re heading into. 
What do you think How happy I am making weapons 
for the family I d know it when it comes. 
You might want to bring about swinging swords. 
But this... to yourself. 
Situation s complicated I told you  Clovis  if we 
don t get out of here soon  No weapons  friends. 
I promise.   It is. 
  The docks are that way. to avoid good men 
such as yourselves. You must be even older 
than you look. I can t say it was a pleasure 
doing business with you.   Wine

She has the numbers. If we want to like Father would have. 
Dead men  dragons  we will defeat it. 
For ourselves  for our house  You. 
People won t like that. The lion does not concern himself 
with the opinions of the sheep.   The king s got a lot on his mind. 
  I understand.   You don t have to worry. 
  You re just Clovis  before he heads off to work 
at the Winterfell forges. You survived King s Landing. 
Yet again. Your Our fathers trusted each other. 
Why shouldn t we  I met yours in my shop. 
  You re a lot leaner. All I ever knew is that 
they fought together and won. Let me come with you. 
Don t be a fool. And he won t be needing a 
smith with a sword like that. I prefer a hammer. 
He can handle himself.  It s better to be 
a coward for a minute  I owe you my life. 
Twice over. I can t wait out this war. 
Yeah  nobody mind me. All right  come on.

How many men did you bring  We were hoping some of 
your men could help. Again  
You re not the only ones. They want to go 
beyond the Wall  too. Our Lord told us that 
the Great War is coming   They re the Brotherhood. 
And the last thing to be murdered. 
Thoros  They won t give me anything

And I realized I was the I tried to run away  but Renly Baratheon 
took me in his arms. nasty little shits aren t worth 
crying over. And he was the king s brother after all. 
But...wasn t he... He saved me from being a joke. 
From that day Nothing s more hateful than failing 
to protect the one you love. How do you fight a shadow  
A shadow with the face   Lord Commander. 
  Your Grace. Lord Commander Mormont s. 
I want him to attend my meetings  Very well. Have you considered my offer  
I have. All my life I wanted to be Jon Stark. 
Say the word and you will be. My place is here. 
I m giving you a chance To rule the North. 
I wish I could fight beside you. I pledged my life to the Night s Watch. 
You re as stubborn as your father. I didn t mean it as praise. 
Honor got your father killed. Can I ask Your Grace 
how long you plan to stay You saved us from Mance Rayder s army. 
We will never forget that. and the wildling prisoners indefinitely. 
Mm  winter is coming. Before the snows trap us here. 
And the wildlings  I leave their fate to you. 
You could execute them  is more willing 
to compromise than Mance ever was. You have many enemies in Castle Black. 
Have you considered sending I heard it was best to 
keep your enemies close. Might not be apparent from his tone  
but it s the truth. He believes in you. But he wants what s right 
for the Seven Kingdoms. He has the blood right to that throne. 
I sworn to stay clear of the politics Not that bit  the bit at the end. 
I m the sword in the darkness    I pledge my life... 
  Okay  that s enough. Now I m not a learned man  
the best way of helping the most people the edge of the world. 
It just might mean wading in the muck And what needs to be done  
As long as the Boltons rule the North  with a coin you never earned  
whose value you do not respect. A lie  a sad little lie. 
  Who are you  Who are you  
You re about to find out. Whose sword is that  
It belongs to Arya Stark. What do you do with them 
after you wash them  Lady Sansa  welcome. 
Lord Bolton. I ll bring you a bowl of hot water. 
You must want to wash. The North remembers. 
Sam. He s not feeling well. 
Take good care of him. As you all know too well  
it s long past time to to appoint 
a latrine captain to It seems like a good job for a ginger. 
Ser Alliser. You proved your valour many times over 
by defending the Wall Lord Janos. 
I m giving you command of Greyguard. Restore it as best you can. 
First Builder Yarwyck can spare... when you were soiling 
your swaddling clothes. say your farewells  
and ride for Greyguard. who cast a stone for you. 
I will not have it. You refusing to obey my order  
You can stick your order The boy thinks he can frighten me  
He s mistaken  yes  very mistaken. in the capital  
You ll see  I was wrong. You re the Lord Commander  
We all serve you. I m sorry. Not only My Lord  please  mercy  Mercy

You have served us well  my son. The Maiden...where is the Maiden  
And the Stranger. What are you doing  
This establishment belong to The Faith of our fathers and forefathers. 
I am the High Septon of the... Sinner  Sinner  
Sinner  Repent  Sinner  Shame on you  
Sinner  Lord Tyrell... 
Uh  it doesn t matter. I give voice to the will of the Gods 
and I am their foremost An assault on my person 
is an assault on our very religion. By those fanatics who 
call themselves sparrows. and bleeding on the cobblestones. 
I am lucky to be alive. Even prostitutes may earn 
the mercy of the Mother. A man s private affairs 
ought to stay private. I ask that you protect our Faith 
by arresting these criminals the so called High Sparrow. 
He s a threat to everything we hold sacred. This High Sparrow  
I don t think this is a These are deeply religious people. 
Where can I find the High Sparrow  High Sparrow  
Sounds ridiculous  doesn t it  We re often stuck with the 
names our enemies give to us. Because I gave them away to 
someone who needed them more. who we really are. 
Is that why you came to King s Landing  time reminding myself. 
Well  I tell them no one s special. It would be comforting to 
believe that  wouldn t it  I d assumed 
you d only come here to arrest me. the chosen representative 
of the Gods in this Lancing a boil is never pleasant. 
Although  they could have been more careful My thoughts on the matter 
align with your own. Having a man like that reside in the Sept 
eats away the Faith from the inside. to protect one another. 
Your Grace. he s slythering about. 
At once  Your Grace.   You ve made progress  
  More than I ve expected. Make sure Littlefinger is clear on 
the meaning of the word  immediate . Come on  children. 
She really is lovely. I ve become quite fond of Lady Sansa 
during our travels together. You have my word. 
I ve heard very little about you. I haven t been a lord very long. 
  I was a bastard. Lord Baelish. 
Yes  father. He seems pleased. 
Shouldn t he be  the law of the land  she s no man s wife. 
Inspect her  if you must. I have delivered everything I ve promised. 
And you prepared for the consequences. through sheer will. 
Without him  not a king to fear. 
The Queen will be enraged. a title whose importance 
wanes with each passing day. whom she can ask for favours. 
A message for you  Strange that the seal is broken. 
I m sure you understand my from the Queen Mother  
it does make me question our new alliance. You gambled when you drove a dagger 
into Robb Stark s heart. I had Tywin Lannister backing. 
Who supports me now  You  an alliance with the lords of the North  
they brought down the greatest dynasty Cersei will expect a reply. 
I d like to read the reply. I have to get out of this wheelhouse. 
The likelihood of you being spotted here I m not sure how many new ways 
I can find of saying this. if I lose my mind. 
I can t remember the last I m losing my mind. 
If anyone recognizes you  of miles from Westeros.

is looking after Emilia  i  to that country. 
 i They send their photos to us  i   i There s two 
departments filming at the same time   i   i because if we do have to

someone lower than he was.   How are you  
  Good. Oh  I want to talk to Peter

and the drone. I ve never met a producer that cares 
for a crew as much as she does. clear a place in that  
So the bridge has to be closed.  i It s their baby.  i  
 i Bernie is the one that keeps  i  will be with us. 
 i Sometimes they are separate so discussing what is in advance. 
As you can imagine  Much like our characters  we 
will go from the amazing Daznak nice list for them every day.  i  
They almost cringe when they see asking my questions. 
 i But they re fantastically  i  Hardhome meeting up in Belfast.

 i but we didn t  i   i they will finally get to see  i

I have done nothing more that on my return

No one cares.   Do you even know what a squire is  
An attendant to a knight.   Will you shut your mouth  
I didn t ask for your advice. I m not a leader. 
All I ever wanted and the rest are monsters. 
You told Lord Royce   But we re heading west. 
  We are. Lord Royce might be as honorable

No. to men who disappoint me. 
So where are we going  deep shock to us all. 
Your father was a   I wouldn t presume to claim 
to have known him  i to make it so clear  i  
just how formidable to be reckoned with. 
Thank you so much This tragedy... 
I never trusted Varys. Cousin Lancel. 
I hardly recognized you. for my son s appearance. 
Uncle  it s quite all right. Religion has its place  
of course  when Tywin was alive. 
I m sure he ll grow out of it    Of course. 
Your wounds from the Blackwater that needed healing. 
What can I do for you  have done to warrant my forgiveness  
I led you into the darkness. I tempted you into our...

You think I want that woman she doesn t go to Highgarden. 
Which means she stays Eunuch  the Spider  the

Not for a coward. Refuse the Kingslayer  
A dangerous proposition. You risked your life

he s not going to get it. You should reopen 
the fighting pits. I told you that. 
She liked to drink pear brandy. I m sorry. 
Why  And I loved to fight. 
So they sold me for the pits. 
I had my first match forced to fight to the death

because of those pits. a Norvoshi priest

Easy. Easy. This doesn t have to be 
our last meeting. He wants me to bend the knee. 
And he wants the free folk he s bold. 
Shouldn t a king be bold  If he gets what he wants  
I expect he ll be a better ruler You told me your people 
have bled enough. Stannis Baratheon either. 
You spent your life convincing Thenns and Hornfoots  
the ice river clans  You didn t do it for power. 
You didn t do it for glory.  i because none of them  i  
 i will survive the winter   i  Isn t their survival 
more important than your pride  This isn t about that. 
Then bend the knee because they respected me. 
Because they believed in me. And how many tens of thousands 
are out there right now  And you won t go out and rescue 
them because why  And burnt to death  
I don t want people But it s better than betraying 
everything I believe. and die standing 
and they ll sing You re a good lad. 
Truly you are. in a foreigner s war  
there s no point explaining. The freedom to make 
my own mistakes the King beyond the Wall. 
Westeros only has one king. Kneel and live. 
This was my home for many years. We all must choose. 
Man or woman  young or old  We choose light 
or we choose darkness.  i and his name is Stannis.  i  
Here stands your king of lies. You alright  
Haven t been North before  That s the North. 
How do you live up here  You ve got to keep moving  
that s the secret. fucking s best. 
There s not a living woman This one is maybe not so smart. 
  Davos says he s a strong fighter. Smart people don t come here 
looking for the dead. She will only fight beside us 
if I bend the knee. Mance Rayder was a great man. 
Proud man. for his pride  
You still mad at us  boy  I ll admit it  it is a subtle distinction. 
We re fighting a great war. I wanted to join the Brotherhood 
but you sold me off. She struck me down on the bed  
she stripped me naked...   Was she naked too  
  She needed your blood. I m not winging. 
Your lips are moving and you complain He was a good man. 
He deserved a better son. The Night s Watch was his life. He would 
have died to protect every one of those men. And my father was the most honorable man 
I have ever met. Your father wanted to execute me  
you know. But it s still Longclaw. 
Lord Commander Mormont thought And it s been in your family for centuries. 
It s not right for me to have it. I brought shame onto my house. 
I broke my father s heart. May it serve you well. 
And your children after you. You probably don t remember  
you were inside knitting all the time. shooting arrows with Ser Rodrick  
I came out here after Ser Rodrick would have 
cuffed him if he saw. No one to stop me. 
So I started shooting. I wasn t very good. 
Finally  I ve hit the bullseye. But I hit the bull s eye. 
And I heard this. smiling down on me. 
I knew what I was doing knew it wasn t wrong. 
The rules were wrong. Now he s dead. 
Killed by the Lannisters. That s your pretty handwriting. 
Septa Mordane used to crack my knuckles I write to you today with heavy heart. 
Our good King Robert is dead.   I remember. 
  Father has been charged with treason. and tried to steal his throne. 
The Lannisters are treating me well swear fealty to King Joffrey 
and prevent any strife between the   They forced me to do it. 
  Did they  you till your bones started to crack  
You should have known what it was like. I would have let them kill me 
before I betrayed my family. And you were stupid enough to believe them. 
I remember you  standing on that platform I remember the pretty dress you were 
wearing  the fancy way you did your hair. Standing in the crown near Baelor s statue. 
And what did you do  Did you Lannisters and save father  
  I wanted to.   I didn t betray him. I didn t betray Robb. 
I didn t betray my entire family We re standing in Winterfell 
again because of me. The Knights of the Vale have won the battle 
and they rode north for me.   Training  
Well  while you were training  I I can imagine quite a lot. 
You never would have You re scared  aren t you  
What are you scared of  be right now if she saw us fighting  
This is exactly what she lords will read it. 
They wouldn   t think much of Lady Sansa You re angry. 
Sometimes anger makes people do unfortunate things. 
I ll go with anger. They told me you were mean. 
Were your born mean or Gingers I hate. 
Gingers are beautiful. Don t point your fucking finger at me. 
Did you trip into the fire Ever since  you ve been mean. 
Fuck off. You want to suck my dick  is that it  
  Dick  I like it. 
Bet you do. me back in Winterfell. 
If I ever get back there. Tallest woman you ve ever seen. 
Almost as tall as you.   Yours is Brienne of fucking Tarth  
Well  not with her yet. I want to make babies with her. 
Think of them. How did a mad fucker like you 
live this long    Who s that  
Your father. Of course I did. 
When he was Hand. brought you back. 
Thoros has brought me back I serve the North. 
The North did not raise you from the dead. don t know what he wants from me. 
He wants your life. That s what anyone can tell me. 
I don t know. I think about that all the time. 
I don t think it s our purpose to understand. Life. 
Death is the enemy. But we all die. 
The enemy always wins. You and I won t fight much 
joy while we re here. understand anymore than that. 
Maybe that s enough. That s what I saw in the fire. 
A mountain like an arrow head. Do you know what I like about you  
  I honestly don t. I ve been heroic on occasion. 
I once charged through the Mud Gate Heroes do stupid things and they die. 
Drogo  Jorah  Daario  They all try to outdo each other. 
You can do the stupidest bravest thing... Daarios  even this... 
Jon Snow... Oh  my mistake. 
I suppose he stares at you longingly because So... 
if all goes well  I ll finally she s rather murder me than speak. 
Oh... Nobody trusts my sister less than I do  
believe me. we ll go with three dragons  
and anyone touches you  And right now she s thinking 
of how to set a trap. trap you re laying for her. 
Are we  new and better world  
I m not sure deceit and mass murder Yes  you ll need to be ruthless if 
you re going to win the throne. It s all my father had... 
And Joffrey. them longs to see them dead. 
Aegon Targaryen got quite how are you different from all the 
other tyrants that came before you  a grip on the Lannister forces. 
Forgive me  but I don t care And I promised him 
I d keep you from doing anything impulsive. We re sitting down with people who 
want to see us both headless. And  
And you ve been known to lose   Perhaps. 
  Perhaps. Perhaps they both needed time to contemplate 
the mistakes in the solitude of a cold cell. One can be forgiven for thinking you re 
taking your family s side in this debate. You need to see things the way they do. 
And you need to see things the way they do Which I want you to do very much. 
Because I believe in you But there are other ways 
of choosing a successor. among their many flaws... 
We will discuss the succession You ve been thinking about my 
death quite a bit  haven t you  I m trying to serve you by 
planning on the long term. we wouldn t have lost Dorne and Highgarden. 
We will discuss the succession Big fucker. 
Do bears have blue eyes  Go on. 
You alright    I don t know. 
She seems very resourceful. in the worst winter any 
of them have ever seen. Many of them will be happy to 
find a good reason to go home. And rule you have. 
Wisely. Some may even prefer you. 
Yes  they turned their backs on Jon they re ready to turn their backs on him again. 
How far would you trust men like that  Arya is not like them. 
She s your sister. Did she not  
She is. wouldn t she be on about to intercede  
She would. How drunk were you when you charged 
through the breach on Pyke  Some of the lads told me 
about it the next morning. It was a proper scrap. 
The Ironborn thought you were I thought you were the bravest man 
I ever saw. tell her what s happened. 
  I m not leaving you. You re faster without the hammer. 
Give it  Go  
What happened  We need to send the raven. 
Get the maester  Now  They say it s one of the better ways to go. 
Lord of Light  lead your servant into the light. 
We have to burn his body. enough to send us a bit of fire. 
Come to us in our darkness. I saw the water. 
When you killed the white walker  Maybe he was the one who turned them. 
We can go for the walkers. We need to take that thing back with us. 
There s a raven flying for Dragonstone now. There s another. 
Kill him. The Lord brought you back... 
and he brought me back... Careful  Beric  you ve lost your priest. 
This is your last life. Every Lord I ve ever met it s been a cunt. 
Can t see why the Lord of Light Milady. 
It s an invitation. I will not set foot in King s Landing while 
Cersei Lannister is queen. Until then  I ll remain where I belong. 
I have work to do here. You said he treated you honourably before. 
I m not worried about me. I have many guards who d happily 
imprison him or behead him You trust he hasn t been speaking 
to them behind your back  He has become a competent swordsman. 
I do not need to be watched of Winterfell and I am home. 
This is the safest place for me. and you won t be travelling 
on summer roads. Yes  Milady. 
You can t    Who else can  
  No one. You can t break the wheel if you re dead. 
  So what would you have me do  hardest thing to do. 
If you die You told to do nothing before 
and I ve listened to you. Oh  fuck. 
Fall back  Help me

and you try to make a lie If I catch a lie  you lose. 
Let s play. Is there someone else you feel should 
rule the North instead of him  Are you sure  
The game of faces didn t turn out so well We both wanted to be other people when 
we were younger. on the Iron Throne. 
I wanted to be a knight Neither of us got to be the other person  
did we  But I can now. 
With the faces I can choose. I can even become you. 
I wonder what it would feel like All I d need to find out 
is your face. I wish I could take it back. 
I wish we d never go. You have to see it to know. 
Now I know. We are going to destroy the Night King 
and his army. Thank you  Dany. 
Dany... Not the company you want to keep. 
Alright. I d...

    So  you   re here to strike a bargain     you   re low on oil  you   re low on men.
    How many are left       I showed you everything I had.
    The whole army    strong.    It wasn   t much. As soon as I saw that 
    I sent  men to climb the Wall     We   re not here to conquer.
    We   re here to hide behind your Wall.    And if my people aren   t south of
the Wall when it comes in earnest     Here   s the bargain.
    You go back  you open the gates to us     and we   ll kill every last man at Castle Black.
    Ah any of them could stop you.
    They   d kill you  of course.    Are you capable of that  Jon Snow 
    Killing a man in his own tent    Is that what you are

    This is Stannis Baratheon you   re not dressed for this weather.
    It is customary to kneel when surrendering to a king.    have nowhere to put them  have nothing to feed them.
    I   m not here to slaughter beat dogs.    Take these men away.
    What   s a man of the Night   swith the King beyond the Wall.
    You   re speaking to the one true king  boy.    My name is Jon Snow  Your Grace.
    I   m Ned Stark   s son.    What do you think he   d have done with him 
    I was this man   s prisoner once.    I think my father would have taken him prisoner 
    listened to what he had to say.     i If my father had seen the things that I   ve seen   i 
    he   d also tell you to burn the dead before nightfall.    It is. The Death   s Head manticore.
    Yes  I   ve read a great deal about it.    Oh  Yes  yes.
    There   s nothing to be done.    Saving him.
    Your Grace  I wish it were otherwise     This man is not even a maester 
    let alone Grand Maester.    You   re dismissed  Grand Maester.
    But  Your Grace  this is my laboratory. scoffs 
 i  door opens   i      i But if my past work is any guide     i 
 i  door slams   i     somewhat.
    Will it weaken him Tywin       i Not another word.  i 
    We   ve been over this. The matter   s closed.    You   re still betrothed to Loras Tyrell.
    And you will marry Loras Tyrell    Your role in that future
    is more vital now than it ever was.I belong with my son the king.
    When you were nine years old brother with me and not you.
    You insisted that you would    Do you think you   ll be the first person
    dragged into a sept to be married against her will     I was sitting on the Iron Throne with Tommen.
    I was about to give him essence of nightshade.    And now you want to ship me off
to Highgarden and steal my boy.    you will dig your claws in
and you   ll fight over himground before I let that happen.
    And how will you do that     You don   t know  do you 
    You never believed it.    How can someone so consumed by the idea of his family
    have any conception what his actual family was doing     One look in the past  years 
    one real look at your own children    Everything they say is true.
    About Jaime and me.    No  no  no  no.
    I don   t believe you.    You won.
    One fewer brother. Must be proud of yourself.    I would do things for my
family you couldn   t imagine.    You don   t get to choose.
    I do. So do you.    Are you really mad enough to blame him for that 
     i He didn   t decide to kill her. He was an infant.  i     What do you decide  What do you choose 
    The things I did to get back to you     Those are words.
    Yes.    I told him I   m staying right here
with Tommen  with you.    What did you say 
    I don   t want to talk about Tywin Lannister.    I love my brother.
    I love my lover.    They   re all so small  I can   t even see them.
    I only see what matters.    I can speak the common tongue if you wish.
    You speak it very well.    I hope I can prove worthy of her admiration.
    What can I do for you     But Master Mighdal and I agreed that I must.
    So I lost my home.    to feed all former slaves and barracks to shelter them.
    I do not mean to offend  Your Grace.    Take what they want and beat us if we resist.
    My Unsullied will make them    Even if they are safe  who would I be there 
    What purpose would I serve     What is it that you want from me 
    Your Grace  I ask you    like a goat or a chair 
    Please  Your Grace.    but for those of us too old to change 
    there is only fear and squalor.    I did not take this city to preside
    over the injustice I fought to destroy.    I will allow you to sign a
contract with your former master.    Thank you  Your Grace.
    Thank you.    will be slaves in all but name.

But I know her sister... her father was beheaded.

to meet a Lannister It looks as though I ve 
taken care of that myself.  i leaves my neck.  i  
She s wanted this  i We met  you and I.  i  
Many years ago. Unlikely. 
You had just been born. not your accents. 
Nothing. you. 
You and my family have more in  i A head twice  i

a girl and a boy.  i When we met your sister  she 
promised she would show you to us.  i   i were a bit small   i  
but no claw. Just a tiny pink cock. 
 i We didn t try to hide  i   i I told Cersei.  i  
 That s just a baby.   i And she pinched  i  
 i your little cock so hard   i   i Until your brother  i  
 i made her stop.  i   i  Everyone says  i  
 i he will die soon.  i   i have lived this long.   i  
Well... and her children. 
If you want justice  I disagree. 
I ve come to have wronged me to justice. 
And all those who have Ser Gregor Clegane

I m building my home  I stay here in the Eyrie. 
Mother says it s dangerous on the of the Vale 
and the Lord of the Vale and someone

No  I m afraid not. That sounds dangerous. 
  How do you make people fly  all the bad people 
and the scary people with them at all. 
Girls didn t take part of the Vale. 
When I grow up  I ll be able back here and  whoosh  
Right through Let s put a Moon Door 
in your Winterfell. in this big tower. 
Careful. to rebuild the whole thing. 
  I didn t ruin it. it didn t have a Moon Door. 
I was fixing it. I shouldn t have done that. 
No  his mother Consider it a step 
in the right direction. Aunt Lysa. 
I was trying to remember A lot can happen 
between now and never. first you must 
demolish the old one. Tell me why. 
I loved your mother more one where love 
could overcome my child. 
But we don t live than she ever was. 
Lord Baelish...  i to see me  Aunt Lysa   i  
Come here  Sansa. No. 
 i Neither do I  precisely.  i  what happens to bodies when they 
hit the rocks from such a height. Like eggs dropped 
on the floor. You ll find the head 
sitting on its own. at nothing. 
I know what you did. I promise it won t happen   
Don t be coy with me  I saw it with my own eyes. 
  He kissed me. I pulled away. My father  my husband  
my sister  That s what happens to people 
who stand between Petyr and me. Look down  Look down  
 i Lysa   i  This empty headed child  
Let her go. I ll send her away. 
I swear on my life. Oh  my sweet wife. 
My sweet  silly wife. only one  
my entire life. The trial will be 
getting under way soon. Go away. 
Grand Maester. and profess your guilt or 
innocence before the Seven  and freely admit to my crimes. 
To which crimes I am guilty of depravity... 
dishonesty  I see that now. 
I humble myself before the Seven beyond the reach of justice. 
But the Mother shows her mercy responsibility for my many sins  i  
and unburden myself of my desires.  i May I be a living example 
of their grace  i  what this means  
I do. I will renounce my lordship 
and my claims on Highgarden.  i Brother Loras...  i  
...I ask you to dedicate against heretics and apostates  
I will. All right. 
I m ready. I m late for the trial. 
 i You mutilated him.  i   i Once the queen mother s 
trial is concluded   i  Her litter never left the Red Keep. 
It appears the queen mother doesn t and show her the way. 
Get the others. you do not deserve 
to die alone in such we can usher in the new  
the old must be put to rest. What are you doing  
There s something wrong. Cersei is not here. 
Tommen is not here. she will be tried regardless. 
We cannot escape listen to what I m telling you. 
Cersei understands the We all need to leave now. 
Loras. Let me through. 
 i Get out of my way.  i   i Confess.  i  
  No. you cared about my atonement.  i  
You did it because it felt good. I drink because it feels good. 
I killed my husband because it I killed your High Sparrow... 
 i and all his little sparrows...  i  because it felt good 
to watch them burn. No thought has ever 
given me greater joy. You ve always been quiet. 
I said my face would be the last Good. 
I m glad to see your face. Now  
Today  for quite a while. 
Ser Gregor. Your gods have forsaken you. 
This is your god now. Shame. 
Shame. Very sorry. 
 i For House Lannister   i  We stand together  
May we stand together And when we drive our swords 
through our enemies  hearts   The Freys and the Lannisters 
send their regards.  You just sit there  
a rich slab of beef    She doesn t want me. 
She wants your golden They have their eyes on you  cunt. 
Not my type. Ser Bronn of the Blackwater  
hero of the Battle of Blackwater Bay  Your father would be pleased. 
I m sure he would be. It wouldn t be right. 
Give the family a bad name. Legendary warrior  everyone said. 
Have you done much fighting No  but back in your day. 
The purpose of fighting Riverrun belonged to House 
Tully for a thousand years. Victory. 
Yes  you re a great conqueror. The Tullys mocked me for years. 
The Starks mocked me. as if you re an expert   i  
but the one battle Stark  the Young Wolf. 
 i But it doesn t matter.  i  have them grovel to our faces 
and snigger behind our backs. They don t fear the Freys  though. 
They fear the Lannisters. Show me. 
Your Grace  What are your thoughts 
concerning the king s funeral   i perhaps a ceremony 
in the throne room   i  Burn him 
and bury his ashes Hello. 
From Lord Commander Snow I m to be the new maester. 
Oh. He died. 
We received no report from shortly after the election. 
He s since passed away. Yes  well  I suppose 
that life is irregular. When we had feasts  
our family would sit up here... You had a family. 
You had feasts. Tell him what you did to her. 
Tell him  The army was trapped. 
The horses were dying. I only do what my Lord commands. 
If he commands you to burn  i Jon Snow is alive 
because the Lord willed it.  i  She was good. She was kind. 
And you killed her  You told everyone 
Stannis was the one.   And you lied. 
  I didn t lie. How many died because you were wrong  
I ask your leave to execute If the Lord was done with 
me  so be it  but he s not. is still to come. 
You know the army of the help you win that war. 
Ride south today. If you ever come back this way  
I will execute you myself. Mother and Father s room  
You should take it. You re the Lady of Winterfell. 
You deserve it. We re Knights of the Vale rode in.  i  
They came because of you. about the Knights of the Vale. 
I m sorry. The last time a Tyrell came to Dorne  
he was assassinated. because we needed your help. 
You came to Dorne because Barbaro  
Obara.  i Don t presume to tell me what I need.  i  
Forgive my sister. What she war on House Tyrell. 
They have declared war on Dorne. Cersei stole the future from me. 
She killed my son. Fire and blood. 
Your ships are nearly ready. Dothraki do on the poison water. 
You re not coming with us. attack from the west coast  
If we take Casterly Rock  You re not going to Westeros. 
You re staying here You will keep the peace while the 
people choose their own leaders. I m here for you  not them. 
You promised me.  i This is what I command.  i  
If I m going to rule in Westeros  alliances is with marriage. 
Who are you marrying this time  But you need to lure all the 
noble houses to the table  A king wouldn t think twice about it. 
So that s what you want  what perfumed aristocrat 
sits beside you in the throne room. I love you. 
And I make you happy. Let me fight for you. 
I can t. Clever fellow. 
Can t argue with his logic. I m not angry. 
I m full of self pity. and the Bay of Dragons. 
Bay of Dragons  You ll get that throne you 
want so badly  I m sure of it. They have no idea 
what s coming for them. No tears. 
I know it was hard for you. because he would have been a 
liability in the Seven Kingdoms. if it s any consolation. 
It s not. Yes  you really are. 
All right  how about the fact you have your ships  
you have your dragons. to want anything  
it s all yours for the taking. You re in the great game now. 
And the great game s terrifying. are madmen like your father. 
Do you know what frightens me  A man I thought I cared for. 
And I felt nothing. I ve been a cynic 
for as long as I can remember. And yet here I am. 
I believe in you. but I don t actually own a sword. 
It s your counsel I need. Good. 
I  um... Tyrion Lannister  
I name you Hand of the Queen. Didn t think so. 
Too pretty. promised to be here by midday. 
They re here  my lord. Forgive me  my lady... 
if you re at prayer. never about what I had. 
I was a stupid girl. I thought you knew what I wanted. 
I was wrong. I close my eyes and see 
the same picture. will this action help to make 
this picture a reality  And I only act if the answer is yes. 
A picture of me on the Iron Throne... You ve declared for other 
houses before  Lord Baelish. The past is gone for good. 
You can sit here of Ned and Catelyn Stark 
born here at Winterfell the dead cannot pass. 
I cannot pass.  i and I still fight for the living.  i  
I ll do what I can... I wish you both good fortune. 
Are you sure you re ready for this  I have to be ready for this. 
 i Ned   i  Is that really you  
You re not a dream  Right here. 
I ve missed you  big brother. You re not going to die. 
Get her some water. Listen to me  Ned. 
If Robert You have to protect him. 
Promise me  Ned. Promise me. 
You can t expect Knights of the Vale We were invited. 
Not by me. The Boltons are defeated. 
The war is over. the coldest one in a thousand years. 
We should ride home And I promise you  friend  
the true enemy Your son was butchered at the 
Red Wedding  Lord Manderly  to House Stark  Lord Glover  
but in their hour of greatest need  your father was skinned 
alive by Ramsay Bolton. The North remembers. 
We know no king but the King in  i Ned Stark s blood 
runs through his veins.  i  Lady Mormont speaks harshly 
and truly. Manderlys dying for nothing. 
But I was wrong. The King in the North. 
I did not fight until my dying day. 
 i A man can only admit There s nothing to forgive  my lord. 
There will be more fights to come. as we have for a thousand years. 
And I will stand behind Jon Snow... The King in the North

If you are Tyrion Lannister  for what it did to mine  
You want revenge Joanna Lannister 
on the day I was born. I am the greatest 
Lannister killer of our time. because you murdered members 
of your own family  only just met. 
It s too soon to know to the fighting pits

during the worst storm in living memory.  i only a name  i

 i He thought  i  worth meeting  
Why should I spend a better world on your own. 
You have no one at your side who and weaknesses of the houses 
 i that will either  i  a very large army 
and very large dragons. When I served 
as Hand of the King  have me do with him

trust a queen who can t keep her promises  he is no longer that man. 
I can t remember  i gives me reason to doubt him.  i  
And yet he did to confess his betrayal  
Yes. He is in love 
with you  I think.  i An unpleasant truth  i  
 i to be sure   i   i He did not trust that you would  i  
 i be wise  enough to forgive him.  i  those devoted to her

True... but you never really do. 
Come  their mother is waiting for you. You begged us to summon 
the King in the North. I ve brought ice and fire together. 
Strange. you hide on a cliff.

House Targaryen in perpetuity. No  of course not. 
But still  an oath is an oath. I am not. 
Oh. to break faith with House Targaryen  
Break faith  I ask your forgiveness

I was born to rule the Seven Kingdoms  and join you in fighting

But if destiny has brought Daenerys Snow King in the North. 
You were the first to Not because of his birthright.
