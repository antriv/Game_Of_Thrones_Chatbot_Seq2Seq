Where did you to do something like that  
tell me first. I didn t have a choice. 
You always knew who I was  do you remember 
the oath you swore better than your swordplay. 
Miles better. The usurper 
Robb Stark is dead. dropped a leech into the fire  
I take no credit. but my eyes were open. 
I don t know if Robb Stark died Everything. 
The boy must die. no matter how 
thirsty you get  Don t. She ll find you. 
Where should I go  They were looking

properly manned in centuries. the Nightswatch now. 
This suits you  Lady Stark. you re not different. 
You re just more of the same. The fuck were you doing 
back there  only I get to kill you. 
That was only one of them. She wasn t your queen 
until recently  though  was she  He d be invaluable at the Wall. 
You cannot send me to the Wall. I shouldn t have 
listened to you. And  
And I have fewer enemies how you feel about that. 
No  I m not. from the Boltons  
Thousands. Jon Snow  this is 
Ser Jorah Mormont  Hard to say whether 
it s the cold  the drink  Wall when no one else could. 
Not the Night s Watch  proposal is forthcoming  
Everyone in Westeros That does seem far more likely 
than magic birds What else could she do  
Not burn him alive I found the traitors  but I wasn t 
the one burning them alive. flesh filled the throne room   
I m not the one doing it. We don t have to 
bring the whole army. down to King s Landing 
and show her the truth. the moment we set foot 
in the capital. He might listen to me. 
And how would you get The King in the North 
should stay in the North. I warned Jon this would happen. 
That he couldn t leave the North These are Mother 
and Father s chambers. Winterfell didn t just 
fall into our hands. and the Hornwoods 
and the wildlings and the Vale. you want people to see 
how you look swinging did he think   
did he think I wanted I ve been thinking about 
with every swing of the hammer  What can I do for you  
  Is that your boat    That they are. 
I try to stay away from them   What  
Fermented crab. He s the Hand of the Queen. 
Why are you here  on the Seven Kingdoms. 
Tyrion claims he ll have proof. Bronn. 
He betrayed you. You re not a soldier. 
No  but I m a fighter. but I ve missed you  Mormont. 
Nobody glowers quite like you. My scouts found them 
a mile south of the Wall. We don t want to go beyond 
the Wall  we have to. Tormund  I ve been to Winterfell. 
Jon  That s the North. Gendry  I wanted to be one of you. 
..I wanted to join the Brotherhood I hate that he died that way. 
And my father was the most honorable man Changed the pommel from a bear to a wolf. 
But it s still Longclaw. He wouldn t say much. 
You probably don t remember  just lying on the ground. 
Ser Rodrick would have only way to save father. 
And you were stupid enough to believe them. What would little Lyanna Mormont say  
She s younger than you I was just a child   
You re angry. Sometimes fear makes them 
do unfortunate things.   You know her  
  You re with Brienne of fucking Tarth  We both serve the same lord. 
I serve the North. I don t know anything about him. I 
don t know what he wants from me. none of us knows what he wants  
I think about that all the time. And she s wondering what 
trap you re laying for her. Which war was won without deceit and mass murder  
Yes  you ll need to be ruthless if This will be a difficult negotiation. 
We re sitting down with people who   As all our great leaders do... 
  When have I lost my temper  You say you can t have children. 
But there are other ways with your brother in King s Landing  
I m trying to serve you by flask 
Go on. Alright. 
How drunk were you when you charged Thoros  
I d say it s one of the better ways to go. We ll all freeze soon. 
I saw the water. Did he do it to watch us freeze to death  
Careful  Beric  you ve lost your priest. Maybe the Lord brought me here to find it. 
Every Lord I ve ever met it s been a cunt. Dumb cunt. 
Oh  fuck. Come on  
Help me  Go now  Leave  
Uncle Benjen  But I can now. 
With the faces I can choose.   Are we riding to battle at Riverrun  
  No. with one of my lieutenants 
at the Stone Mill about that damned mill  
And don t call him  nephew.  I meant him no disr   
You re lucky I m not your king. I think King Robb understands 
we re not gonna win this war Instead  I have a mill. 
 i We took hostages.  i  into the fold. 
Then the young wolf can add If you had armed me  
they never would have taken us. Or maybe people just love 
to overpraise a famous name. More than once. 
None of these fellows have What does it matter  
  What does it matter   i little lady.  i  
  What am I   i A coward s weapon.  i  
 i I like to fight up close.  i  I was surprised when he died. 
Didn t think death for so long  they don t 
remember my real name. did Bran or Rickon 
stare across the moors of his enemies. 
True. And take this one. 
He knows Castle Black s old friend  
Hide near Castle Black. those who are right with the gods. 
The real gods.  i Push.  i  
That s it. we don t stand a chance. 
I can ride.   I am sworn to serve you. 
  Then serve me. I want Joffrey dead. 
I want Robb Stark dead. That will mean blood on your 
hands before the thing is done.  i still in training as well.  i  
Master Greizhen says they worth what they cost to feed  
 i but Master Kraznys will give  i  Khaleesi  please. 
Three dragons. One. 
 i They want the biggest one.  i  you ll be advising 
someone else. This one s name 
is Missandei  Your Grace. Do you know what he said to me  
 Let me die.   i they are yours.  i  
They will fall on their swords on my new position  
Keep a low profile. You want a real challenge  
Try whores. Enjoy the Eyrie. 
Come on  I m here later. with my colleague Ser Bronn  
I finally found handler herself. 
She s here to thank you If we fail to repay these loans  
the bank will fund our enemies. the time for free  
Is that what you re telling us  was mined on Tarth. 
 i Sapphires are gemstones.  i   i But only if she s alive   i  
her honor unbesmirched.  i Unchain Ser Jaime  i  
 i from the tree.  i  something to eat. 
I m famished  actually.  i     Three boys  a goat   i  
 i and a dancing bear      i   i     How sweet she was   i  
 i so pure and fair      i   i     He smelled that girl  i  
 i in the summer air      i  it would be a shame 
to throw it away. the peace she needs 
and promise to carry the Black and live out your days 
on the Wall with your brother to the Lannisters. 
He s grandfather s bannerman. Just march up to his gates 
and tell him you re crossing. the last one either. 
Or the one before that. of his children to mine. 
I m sure there To ask you 
to open your gates  the Trident and be on their way. 
Why should I let him  It s called Longclaw. 
Works as well for a wolf It was meant 
for my son Jorah. My Lord  you honor me  
but I can t   that thing s wrist   
I ve ordered Thorne to lay it   Let s have a look. 
  Piss off. I read the message 
to Maester Aemon. to his side. They ll keep him safe. 
I should be there. he want in return  
You will be taking on his son Then I consent. 
Sam said you wanted If the day should ever come when 
your lord father was forced to choose   I know. 
  You do not know  but he is my father 
and Robb is my brother. They waited till I was old. 
What could I do when the ravens And he was followed 
by his son Aerys  You re Aemon Targaryen. 
I m a Maester He said something. 
Well  the odds of me Ki ha   hammi... 
Ish nokitta...   He will die tonight  Khaleesi. 
  He can t. He won t want any rivals. 
Your boy will be plucked I won t leave him.

Bring me his horse. They say

Ahhh.   Just used to it. 
  Drink. I could teach you   
Does it involve the potential   No  
No more fire games  Fine. 
Bronn first. You came from somewhere 
and you wanted to be elsewhere. So specifics   
you wanted to be elsewhere  perhaps. 
Not another night. when we heard a scream. 
She ran out onto the road  Jaime scared away the men easily 
enough  while I wrapped her in my cloak. so while Jaime 
hunted down the rapers I forgot how afraid 
I was around girls  everything but Tysha. 
And somehow I found I would have killed the man 
who did that to me.   You don t have a squire. 
If I die  weep for me.   Move aside
